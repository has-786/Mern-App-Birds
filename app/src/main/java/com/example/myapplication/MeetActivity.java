Many Shiite scholars have talked about their meetings with Imam al-Mahdi (a) during the Major Occultation. However, some other scholars, such as al-Nu'mani, believe that it is impossible to meet the Imam (a) during the Occultation. The most important evidence in this regard is the last tawqi' by Imam al-Mahdi (a) addressed to his fourth deputy according to which whoever claims to have met the Imam (a) is called a liar. Some people believe that this is restricted to those who claim that they met the Imam (a) along with being his deputy or representative. Some hadiths have recommended supplications and practices for meeting Imam al-Mahdi (a), and there are hadiths according to which it is possible for special followers of the Imam (a) to have contact with, and meet, him. Some scholars, such as al-Shaykh al-Saduq and al-Shaykh al-Tusi have devoted particular chapters of their books to stories of people who have met the Imam (a) and have explicitly confirmed the possibility of meeting him. People who are said to have met Imam alMahdi (a) include: Mirza Muhammad Husayn Na'ini, Sayyid b. Tawus, Ibrahim alKaf'ami, Muhammad Taqi al-Majlisi, Abu lHasan Sha'rani, al-Shaykh al-Hurr al-'Amili, al-Muqaddas al-Ardabili, Mirza Muhammad Astarabadi, al-Shahid al-Thani, al-Sayyid Bahr al-'Ulum, al-Sayyid Ni'mat Allah al-Jaza'iri, and al-Shaykh Murtada alAnsari.");

        edetails.add("There are two views about meeting with Imam al-Mahdi (a) during the Major Occultation. Some people believe that it is possible and has occurred as well. The During the Major Occultation view was first propounded by al-Sayyid alMurtada and then became popular among recent scholars. It was also propounded by al-Muhaddith al-Nuri, al-Karajuki, and alShaykh al-Tusi. According to al-Sayyid alMurtada, it is possible for divine saints to meet with Imam al-Mahdi (a). It seems that initially it was only the possibility of such a meeting which was at issue, but since the time of Sayyid b. Tawus (d. 664/1265) when the stories of such meetings were reported, its occurrence became certain, although some of the stories go back to earlier times. For example, the first story is that of Ibn Qulawayh (d. 367/977) in 339/950. In some hadiths, supplications and practices are mentioned for meeting with Imam alMahdi (a). Many scholars wrote works in this regard and there are many accounts of people who claim to have met with Imam al-Mahdi (a). However, some other Shiite scholars maintain that it is not possible for the Shi'as to meet with Imam al-Mahdi (a) during the Major Occultation. One of the most significant arguments for this view is the last letter of Imam al-Mahdi (a) addressed to the Fourth Deputy in which he referred to people who claim to meet him as liars. Thus, according to the Imam's (a) command, any claim to meet him should be rejected.");

The lamps of the haram paled in comparison with the brightness of this light just as any light would seem pale before the brightness of the sun.

The people had already gathered for prayers. My respected companion however stood separately towards the right side of the imam leading the prayer and began reciting his prayers. I stood in the first row of the congregation and began the prayers. When I completed my prayers, I looked in the direction where the respected Sayyed was praying, but I could not see him. I quickly got up from my place and looked all over for him – outside the mosque and at every place in the haram, but could not find him.

                "Suddenly, an amazing feeling passed over me. It was as if I had got up from a dream. A few thoughts passed through my mind – who was this respected Sayyed, my companion? There were so many miraculous events that occurred during my journey with him. He convinced me to return with him to Kazmain, despite the fact that I had made up my mind not to return today. I had never seen him before, yet he was familiar with my name. His knowledge of the hidden things in my heart and his bearing witness to my faith, the flowing of the river, the presence of the trees laden with fruits despite the fact that it was not the season for them, and replying to the salaam which I recited for Imam Mahdi (as)!\n" +

It was about one month since this event that I was in Kazmain where a respected Sayyed walked up to me and said, what have you seen? I said, I have not seen anything. He repeated the question and I repeated my answer. This time I was more firm in my reply than before. Suddenly he disappeared from my eyes and then I did not see him again. It struck me that he was none other than my master Hazrat Imam Mahdi (as). I regretted that at the time of meeting me, I was not attentive towards him. I searched all over for him but regretfully, I could not meet him again. I was grieved at my separation from him.");

He narrates his meeting with Imam Mahdi (as) as follows.In my youth I had decided that I would raise my level of piety to that extent that when I would travel for Hajj to Makkah, I would get an opportunity to meet Imam Mahdi (as). Therefore with this intention, I travelled for Hajj every year to Makkah. In one particular year, when I went for Hajj, I was having the responsibility of a few Hajis. On the eve of 8th Zilhajj, I decided to gather all my belongings and items and go to the ground of Arafat so that I would be able to prepare and book a good place for my companions when they would arrive the next day.\n" +

There was a guard at the entrance of the tent and he came to me and said, “Why have you come here today? Do you not know that you are alone here? Your belongings could be stolen by thieves who operate in this area. In any case since you have come here, it is better that you remain awake the entire night and guard your belongings.” I said, “No problem. I will remain awake till morning and guard my possessions.”\n" +

His rule was the last by a king related to the sadaat (from the progeny of Hazrat Zahra (sa)).I had reached Makkah Mukarramah for Hajj and at every stage – Tawaaf, Arafah, Mina and Mash’har – I sought the Ziyarat (meeting) of Imam Mahdi (as). From the traditions of the Imams (as), I was 100 percent sure that Hazrat Imam Mahdi (as) comes to Makkah Mukarramah every year during the season of Hajj for the Ziyarat of Kabah. That year, I had intensely prayed to Allah that He grant me the opportunity to meet Imam Mahdi (as). However, the days of Hajj came to an end and I was unable to meet the Imam (as).\n" +

                "I was now in a dilemma. At that time, my options were I could either go back to my home town and return next year for Hajj to once again seek an audience with the Imam (as); or I could wait in Makkah for one year till the season of Hajj and pray to Allah the Merciful that He accept my supplication for meeting the Imam (as). Finally keeping my conditions in mind, I decided to stay back in Makkah with the hope that during the season for Hajj, I would be granted an opportunity to perform the Ziyarat of the House of Allah and also the Ziyarat of the true successor of the Kaabah.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Anyhow I completed one year in Makkah till the arrival of the season of Hajj. I completed the rituals of Hajj, but I was not granted an audience with the Imam (as). In a state of utter hopelessness and regret I once again contemplated the further course of action – should I return to my home town or should I stay back. Perhaps Allah, the Acceptor of Duas would consent to my supplication to meet my beloved, the Imam of the Time (as).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Finally, I decided to stay back with the sole intention of meeting my master. For another year, I endured the difficulties of staying in a foreign land and awaited the long cherished meeting with the Imam (as) till such time that the Hajj season returned. At every stage, I yearned for one meeting with the Imam (as). However, this year too, like earlier, Allah had ordained otherwise and I was unable to meet with the Imam (as).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "I began thinking about the future – what should I do? For how long could I stay in a foreign land? I thought that perhaps, it was not to be that I should meet the Imam (as) and maybe it would be better if I returned home. For long my family and friends would be awaiting my return. Then it struck me that I should not despair of Allah’s mercy. Perhaps I would get a chance this year to meet the Imam (as). Who knows what fate awaited me at home; would I get such an opportunity to come back to Makkah? Would the conditions at my home permit me to return? These thoughts raced through my mind as I thought that perhaps I would not get another chance to fulfil my hope to meet the beloved Imam (as). Therefore, I decided to stay back for one more year. Surely Allah the Almighty is the One who creates opportunities; He is the One who solves the difficulties. I was lost in these thoughts when I decided to stay back and with this hope I spent 5 years in Makkah with the intention of meeting the Imam of the Time (as).\n" +

                "\n" +
                "The season of Hajj arrived in my last year of stay in Makkah and I completed its rituals. I stood before the Kaabah and clutching its curtain, I wept profusely and prayed to Allah – O Lord! For so many years I stayed in this strange land with the anticipation of meeting the Imam of the Time (as), but till now You did not grant me the opportunity for this meeting!? I remained in this condition for a long time and confided my secrets to Allah.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Finally, I separated from the Kaabah and climbed one of the mountains of Makkah. At this height I looked around and saw a green patch. Inexplicably, a wave of happiness spread through my body on this sight. I asked myself – what is this place which is green and prosperous in the outskirts of Makkah? How is it that after all these years that I spent in Makkah, I missed this place and never came here?\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Finally, I came down from the mountain towards this place. As I approached this lush garden, my eyes fell upon a tent right in the centre that looked very regal. I carefully measured my steps and moved towards this tent. I saw some people sitting in the tent. They were listening to a majestic personality whose radiant countenance gave an impression of servitude and worship. I came closer and entered the tent. I saw that there were several people gathered in the tent. I stood at one side and directed my attention to the words of this person.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "He was saying – One of the miracles of my mother Hazrat Zahra (sa) is that the children from her progeny die on the correct faith; at the time of their death a reminder of the faith and wilayat is done to them; and none of them departs this world, except on the right belief.\n" +

                "I heard this for a moment looked towards the green garden and then as I turned my attention to the tent, I realised that the tent and the people within it had completely disappeared. There was no sign of them. I was surprised by this and once again turned towards the green area, but I now realised that there was no sign of it as well. I found myself alone on the mountain in the middle of the sands of the deserts of Hejaz. I descended from the mountain and entered the city of Makkah where another surprise awaited me. It appeared that the atmosphere of the city had changed. People were whispering amongst themselves and the administration of the city appeared to be in a state of grief. I asked the people about what had occurred.\n" +
                "\n" +

Several scholars and jurists from the schools of the Ahle Sunnah (Hanafi, Shafaei, Maliki and Hambali) were gathered around his bed. Even his son Shareef Hussain was present there. The scholars of the Ahle Sunnat were reciting the talqeen (last reminders for the dying person) as per their own beliefs. However there was no movement on the lips of the king. I too sat next to the bed of the king.\n" +

He said, O Shareef Ali say – Ash’hado An La Ilaha Ilallah. At that moment, there was a movement on the lips of the king and he repeated – Ash’hado An La Ilaha Ilallah (I bear witness that there is no God but Allah).\n" +

                "The person said, O Shareef Ali, say – Ash’hado Anna Mohammadur Rasoolullah (I bear witness that Mohammed (sawa) is the Messenger of Allah). Shareef Ali repeated – Ash’hado Anna Mohammadur Rasoolullah.\n" +

At that moment Shareef Ali also breathed his last and passed away. I gathered my wits and speedily went outside to seek this person, but I could not find him. I asked the courtiers and the gate keepers to the palace, but they replied that no person had entered nor left from the palace. I returned back to the palace and found that the scholars of the four schools of the Ahle Sunnah were discussing the last words of Shareef Ali amongst themselves.

        edetails.add("Janab Maynou narrates – I visited Karbala several times for Ziyarat. On one such visit, I decided to first pray at the place of the blessed head of Imam Husain (as) – the place where duas are accepted very swiftly – for the opportunity to meet Imam Mahdi (as). I intended that I would recite the Ziyarat will full attention after seeking this dua.I reached the Euphrates and after having a bath and washing my clothes, I left for the shrine of Imam Husain (as). Along the way, I kept thinking about the supplication for the opportunity to meet Imam Mahdi (as). At last, I reached the shrine of Imam Husain (as). In my heart I hoped that I would not be disturbed by some uneducated Arabs who would come over and request to recite the Ziyarat in a loud voice so that they could listen and take benefit from it. I made an intention that after reciting the Izne Dukhool (prayer for seeking permission to enter the shrine), I would recite Ziyarat Jameah. I barely had stood for the Izne Dukhool when an Arab came over and stood by my side and said, Mister! Can you please recite Ziyarat loudly so that I may recite it along with you? I was a bit annoyed by this request because I wanted to recite Ziyarat in solitude. I thought to myself that since this person is a visitor of Imam Husain (as), I would recite a short Izne Dukhool for him and then I would recite a comprehensive Ziyarat. Thus I recited Izne Dukhool and after entering the shrine, I faced the blessed grave of Imam Husain (as), then turned to the Arab and said, which Ziyarat would you like me to recite for you? He said, Ziyarat Waretha. I started the recitation of the Ziyarat. I had barely completed the first sentence of the Ziyarat – Assalamo Alaika Ya Waretha Adama Safwatillah – that this Arab started weeping profusely. As I recited the Ziyarat, the intensity of his lamentation kept on increasing in such a manner that when I reached the sentence – Assalamo Alaika Ya Tharallahe Wabna Thaarehi – he was weeping so much that I too was affected by it. I also started weeping severely such that I was unable to continue the recitation of the Ziyarat. I recited the Ziyarat one sentence at a time, following each sentence with severe lamentation. I thought to myself that I had not wanted to be disturbed, however the presence of this Arab had cast a strange feeling over me. While reciting the Ziyarat, I witnessed some lights which had engulfed the shrine in their brightness. However, at that time, I dismissed the thought thinking that perhaps the tears in my eyes were playing tricks with my vision. Finally, with a lot of difficulty, I was able to complete the Ziyarat and then the Arab and I moved towards the zarih of Imam Husain (as). We moved to the side of the zarih to recite the namaz of Ziyarat. After completing my namaz, I turned towards my partner in order to remind him of a prayer which should be recited after this namaz. However, when I turned, I saw that he was not there. I thought that perhaps he had gone to perform a Tawaaf (circumambulation) of the zarih. I got up from my place and performed a Tawaaf while looking for him. I could not see him and in that effort completed another Tawaaf of the zarih. But I was unable to find him. This surprised me – how is it that he was with me just a few moments ago, but now he seemed to have disappeared. Anyway, in his search, I even stepped outside the shrine, but could not find him. I was anxious and came to the caretaker of the shoes of the pilgrims and said to him, just a short while ago, an Arab entered the shrine along with me. Have you seen him? He replied, actually, I did not see any person accompanying you. At that time it struck me that the Arab was none other than the Imam I was seeking, my beloved Imam Mahdi (as). As soon as this thought came into my mind, I was dumbfounded. My mind did not know how to respond to the situation and it was as if an extraordinary feeling had overcome me. I began thinking of where I should search for him. I entered the shrine again so that I may search for him inside, but I could not find any trace of him. I anxiously looked for him everywhere but I was unable to find him. I sat next to the zarih and wept profusely praying that I would get an opportunity again to meet him. I was saying, O Master! I did not want to meet you in this way. Rather I desired that I should meet you in the condition that I would recognise you. O my Master! I will not leave the shrine till such time that I get the chance to meet you once again. Hardly these words had left my lips that a hand appeared and caught my finger which was raised towards the heavens. A voice was heard saying, “As Alokad Dua” (I seek your prayers) On hearing this voice, I turned in its direction, but I could not see any person. However these words which were from the lips of my master were like a cool balm for my burning heart. I thought to myself that I was unworthy of meeting my master more than this.The reason of construction of Masjid Jamkaran was that that ShaykhAfifSaaleh Hasan bin MuthlaJamkarani says: It was the night of Tuesday, the seventeenth of the month of Ramazan 293 A.H. – and I was asleep in my house. A part of the night had passed. Some people came to my door and woke me up saying: Get up, SahibuzZamaan has summoned you. So I arose at once and said: All right, I\\’ll be there immediately. I picked up a shirt to put it on, but a voice came from inside the house: This is not your shirt. I put on another shirt; then reached for the Pajama; again a voice came that it was not mine. So I put it down and wore another. After that I started to search for the key, but a voice came: The door is already open. At last, Ireached the door to find many elders standing there. I greeted them; they replied and then conveyed me to the location where the Masjid stands today. At that place I decried a wooden platform covered by a very fine carpet. A mattress and pillows were also arranged on it and a young man of around thirty years was seated there. Before him was an elderly gentleman, reading from a book. Around sixty persons, some dressed in white and some in green, were busy praying. I learnt that the young man was HazratHujjat and the elderly gentleman was His Eminence, Khizr (a.s.). When I reached them, His Eminence, Khizr (a.s.) offered me a seat and HazratHujjat addressed me by my name and said: “Go to Hasan Muslim and tell him: You have put this land for your personal use since some years, and you try to cultivate crops on it, but we destroy them, in spite of that you do not desist. This year also you wanted to do the same. Now, you are not permitted to do so; and return whatever you have gained from this land, so that it can be utilized for building a Masjid on it. Tell him that this is an honored place and the Almighty Allah has bestowed it a special rank over other lands, which you are trying to include in your property. Your two adolescent sons passed away, but you did not heed the warnings. If you still don\\’t toe the line, you will be punished in such a way that you won\\’t know what hit you.” Hasan Maslah says: I said: My master, I would need a sign, as without it, no one would believe me. He said: We are leaving a sign here in order to verify your statements, you just convey the message. Go to Abul Hasan and ask him to recover from HasanMuslim the profits he had made in last few years and hand the money over to others so that construction may commence; and the remaining expenses can be taken from the agricultural income of our lands at Rahaq. We have endowed half of this rural property in favor of this Masjid. Announce it to the people that they should become inclined to it and be devoted to it. They should recite four units (rakats) of prayer in it: Two units (rakats) of prayer for honoring of Masjid: in each unit (rakat) of which they should recite Surah Hamd once and Surah Tauheed seven times; in Ruku and Sujood, they should recite the praises seven times. After that recite two units (rakats) of Prayer of Imam Zamaan (a.s.), in the following manner: Begin with Surah Hamd and when you come to IyyakaNa\\’bodowaiyyakaNaste\\’e\\’n, you should repeat this a hundred times and then proceed and complete Surah Hamd. The same method is to be followed in the second unit (rakat) as well. Repeat the Zikr seven times in Ruku and Sujood. After concluding the prayer, recite the Tahleel, e.g. Laaelaahaillallaahowahdahuwahdahu. And recite Tasbeeh Fatima Zahra (s.a.). After that prostrate and recite Salawat on Muhammad and Aale Muhammad (a.s.) in prostration a hundred times. After that the Imam\\’s words were as follows: If one recites the two prayers, it is as if he has prayed in the BaitulAteeq. After that Imam (a.s.) asked me to proceed. As soon as I started, he called me back and said: A goat is to be purchased from the flock of Ja\\’farKashani, the shepherd; if the villagers pay for it, well and good, if not, you pay for it yourself and slaughter it here tomorrow night. The following daywould be the 18th of month of Ramazan; on that day the mutton should be distributed among those who are ailing; Allah will cure those who eat from it. That goat is spotted, very hairy and having seven black and white marks the size of a dirham coin: three on one side and four on the other. Hasan bin Maslah says: After that I returned home and remained in deep thought all night. At last it was dawn. After prayers, I went to Ali bin Mundhir and narrated the whole incident to him. Then the two of us came to that same place and found in accordance to the statement of the Imam, chains and pegs, which were supposed to be the signs . After that we came to the place of SayyidAbul Hasan. The moment we reached his door, his servants said: The master is expecting you since dawn, are you a residents of Jamkaran? Then he was informed and I entered his place and greeted him with respect. He replied in a cordial way and offered me a seat near him. Before I could say anything, he started: O Hasan bin Maslah, last night I saw a gentleman in dream,who told me: Hasan bin Maslah, a resident of Jamkaran, will approach you in the morning. You must testify to whatever he says and rely on his words; his statement is our statement; you must not reject his words. I am waiting for you since I saw that dream. After that I narrated the incident in detail. Abul Hasan asked his men to saddle the horses. All of us mounted and set out from there. On reaching Jamkaran, we saw Ja\\’far with his herd at the side of the road. As I approached, a goat, which was at the rear, came bouncing to me. When I wanted to pay the cost to Ja\\’far, he swore that the goat did not belong to his herd. He said: I have never seen it before today and after that I was not able to catch it, no matter how much I tried. Thus, we brought that goat to the place that Imam (a.s.) had mentioned and slaughtered it there. Sayyid Abul Hasan summoned Hasan Muslim and the amount was recovered from him. Monies were also taken from the income of Rahaq village and the roof of the Masjid was completed. SayyidAbul Hasan carried those chains and pegs with him to Qom; they were kept at his home. Ailingpersons came and by Allah\\’s permission sought cure from them by rubbing them on their bodies. It is said that after the passing away of SayyidAbul Hasan, when his son fell ill, the case containing the chains and pegs was opened, but nothing was found in it .This, in brief, is the account of that place, which is mentioned there. The author says: In the Persian version of Taareekh Qom,and in its Arabic version, which the prominent scholar Agha Muhammad Ali Kermanshahi has mentioned this incident briefly in the marginal notes of Rejaal Mir Mustafa in the chapter of Hasas, the date of the incident is mentioned as 293 A.H. And apparently it was abrogated and the actual date was 273 A.H., which is the meaning of seventy, because the death of Shaykh Saduq was before 290 A.H.");

And as for those who cry upon his difficulties, in exchange for each tear, Allah forgives their large and small sins.\n" +

During this hunt, the king was separated from his courtiers such that they were both unable to reach each other. He tried his best to make contact with his companions, but was unsuccessful. He was tired and so weakened that even walking was difficult for him. Hungry and thirsty, he just did not know what to do. Suddenly he saw a tent in the distance and started walking towards it.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "An old woman stayed in the tent along with her son. Her only worldly possession was a goat with whose milk she was able to eke out a living. When the king arrived at her door step, she did not recognise him. Nevertheless, she was hospitable to him. She sacrificed her goat and fed its meat to the king as she did not have anything else to offer to him. The king ate to his fill and stayed there for the night. The next morning the king graciously took her leave and was soon reunited with his companions. Thereafter, he narrated the previous night’s episode to his companions and then asked them –\n" +

                "One of the courtiers stood up and said, O king! You can pay her back by granting her 100 sheep. Another courtier proffered, you can grant her 100 sheep and 100 gold coins. A third suggested that the king gift her a particular piece of land.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The king said, whatever I grant her, it will fall short of the favour she has conferred upon me.

(It is not possible that the Divine will grant His divinity to the Imam (as)). Therefore if Allah rewards the visitors and mourners of Imam Hussain (as) in this manner, then you should not be astonished for this is an ordinary task and very easy for Him (Undoubtedly, this is Allah whose award is without any limit, whose bounty is all encompassing and whose generosity is beyond compare such that none can estimate its extent)\n" +

I searched for him in the nearby area and up to the distance I could see, I looked for him, but I could not get the chance of meeting him (as).

Since I was in extremely poor financial conditions, whenever I decided to go with a caravan, I did not have the provisions for the journey and I was compelled to stay behind. Once, when some pilgrims set out, after they left, I decided not to leave this caravan in any way.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Winter was approaching and I had no clothes and I would perish in that climate. If I was unable to get a caravan and if I died of hunger or thirst it would be better. So I set out from the holy sanctuary in the afternoon. I came out of the town and took the road on which those pilgrims had departed; but I did not meet anyone till sunset. So much so that night fell and I had nothing to eat. I was terribly hungry and in that forest nothing was seen, except trees of bitter colocynth. In restlessness of hunger I picked quite a few of them that perhaps I will be able to consume them, but I did not succeed. After walking sometime I saw a mound and I climbed it. There I saw a spring, which amazed me a great deal and I thanked the Almighty Allah and drank from it thinking that as I was facing a certain death, I should perform ablution and pray so that I may not die leaving prayers unperformed.\n" +

It was a dark night and the wilderness was terrifying and I was involved in the difficulties of the journey. In that condition I was only reminded of God and the believers in God. I fell down on the earth and felt a rider approach. I thought that death was near.\n" +

He said: You are hungry. Eat one of them now and take two with you and depart from this straight path. Then eat half a fruit in the morning and half in the afternoon. But keep the third one safe as you will be in need of it. You will reach a black tent by nightfall and the owners of that tent will convey you to the caravan. Saying this that person disappeared.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "I arose and plucked those musk melons. Ate one of them immediately which was so sweet and tasty that I had never eaten anything so delicious before. I took two musk melons with me and set out on the road suggested by that gentleman till the sun arose. I cut this second musk melon and ate half of it. When it was afternoon I ate the other half. My journey continued. Night began to fall and it was the time of sunset, when I decried that tent. Some people emerged from the tent and they came running to me and held me tight and took me as if I was a spy. When they brought me before their leader, he asked me in a threatening manner: Where do you come from? Tell the truth or I will kill you.\n" +

Secondly the distance from here to Mashhad Muqaddas is a journey of three days. Now, tell me the truth or I will eliminate you. He pulled out the sword, but he noticed the musk melon with me. I narrated the whole story to him hearing which all them unitedly said: Firstly, there is no musk melon tree in this wilderness; secondly how is its presence possible when we have not seen the like of it. Then they thought for sometime and discussed among themselves from which I understood that they now believed in my truthfulness and they understood that it was a miracle of Imam (as). Then they changed their attitude. All of them kissed my hands and accorded great honor to me. They took away my garments as blessings and provided me with new clothing. They kept me as a guest for two days and on the third day gave me ten Tumans and sent three persons with me till I joined that caravan.");

In my sleep I saw a dream in which I was blessed with the ziyarat of Imam Mahdi (as). He came towards me and asked me the cause of my worry.

                "The next night I left my house and happened to meet a person who was with Aqa Bafeqi the previous night. He said to me, “We had kept a place for you last night. Aqa Bafeqi first took us to Masjide’ Jamkaran. It was an amazing night. For some reason, we felt as if it was not snowing. The ground on which we were walking was completely dry. So we were able to reach our destination very quickly. When we reached the Masjid, we saw that there was no one there. It was however very cold there and we did not know what to do.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In those days, Masjid Jamkaran was a small broken down place. There was no building like there is today. Only a few people used to visit the place and benefit spiritually from it.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Suddenly we saw that a respected Sayyed walked into the Masjid. He said to Aqa Bafeqi, “If you desire tea and some items for your comfort, I can organise them for you.” Aqa Bafeqi said, “Whatever you think best.” The Sayyed went out of the Masjid and returned after some time with the items. This was very surprising because there were no inhabitants in that area, yet he was able to procure all these things without much difficulty.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "When the Sayyed was about to leave, one of our companions asked him, “Are you going to go to Qum early in the morning? In that case, who should we leave these things with?” The Sayyed said, “The one who has brought these things will take them back also.” Saying this, he left from there. After he left, we began thinking how this Sayyed was able to arrange all these items so quickly since the area was not inhabited. Even if he had brought it from the village of Jamkaran, it would have been very difficult for him in this cold and snowy weather. In any case, we spent the night in comfort and ease and early in the morning, we left those things there and came back to Qum.”\n" +

Within a few days another abscess appeared between his knees and calf and after another few days another abscess appeared in his thigh and a third abscess between the shoulders; each of which became infected and were very painful. They festered and became full of puss.\n" +

                "More than a year passed in that condition and all kinds of treatments were taken, but none proved effective.

He spoke to him in private for some time and we concluded from what we overheard that he was conveying the message of despair to him and he was concealing it from me lest I should inform my mother. Then he became distressed and very much worried.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Then my father returned. That surgeon said: I will take this much as advance and then I will begin the treatment and his aim was that the denial of my father would become an excuse for him to leave before starting the treatment.\n" +

My brother dropped that letter into the well and it remained suspended at the top of the well in the hands of the mother and this moved both of them and they wept intensely; and it was the last hour of Friday.\n" +

My brother was lying on his back or leaning on his bed as was his practice most of the time. The Imam (as) approached with a spear which he passed over his body and said, Get up, as your uncle has returned from the journey.\n" +

                "\n" +
                "His son, Shamsuddin narrated to me that his father said that an abscess came up on his left thigh and became as big as a fist. This abscess was there for a long time and it particularly gave him severe pain during the spring season. He used to lose a lot of blood through it. He said that he wasn’t able to properly offer his mandatory prayers because of the abscess. He worried so much about this that he went from his village to the town of Hilla. There he met Sayyed Raziuddin Ibne Taaoos, who was the most eminent scholar of the Shia during those days although he wasn’t recognized as their Marja, only, perhaps because he abstained from issuing edicts to the believers.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Ismail Harqali met him and explained his problem to him. Sayyid Raziuddin called all the physicians of Hilla and sought their advice. They suggested that the only possible cure was the amputation of the abscessed limb. But they also said that there was great risk even in amputation, because there was the risk of severance of some vital veins in the process of amputation. The physicians were believers, and they didn’t want to give him careless advice.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Sayyid Raziuddin told Ismail Harqali: “The Shariah gives permission to offer your prayers despite the impurity of the pus oozing from the abscess.” He said, in fact, prayers in such excruciating conditions will be doubly felicitous.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Now, there was only one city, Baghdad, where there could perhaps be a possibility of his finding a cure. Baghdad was the capital of the realm of Islam and scholars of all disciplines were assembled there. Ismail Harqali thought that he must head for Baghdad. He met the personal physician of the Caliph and went to heavy expenses to take his treatment. He spent all his money, but the cure was not in sight. He had spent all his funds and was then subject to abject penury. He now thought that he would go and seek the help of the Imam Mahdi (as) in Samarrah. Therefore, he proceeded from Baghdad to Samarrah.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "For many days he continued to visit the Mausoleum of the Imams (as) and also visited the cellar from where the Imam Mahdi (as) went into Ghaybat. Although the cellar at Samarrah isn’t the abode of the Imam (as), it is certainly associated with his memory. Many days went by when he thought that there was no hope of his recovery from the abscess and he was thinking of returning home disappointed. He thought that he had left his wife and children at home long enough and that he must go back to them.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Therefore, the next morning, early with the sunrise, he went out of the ramparts of the city. Near the ramparts was flowing the river Tigris. He took a bath there and wanted to visit the mausoleums to bid adieu to the Imams (as). He changed into a clean dress and carried water in a pitcher for cleaning the abscess if it suppurated.. This was as a caution for his entering the mausoleum in a clean state. As he entered the ramparts of the town, he found four persons cantering on horses towards him. Their personalities and garments were different from those of the Samarrans. He thought that they must be some travelers passing through the town.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "They came near him and suddenly stopped. Two of them were youths. They came and stood on his left. There was one elderly person who stood on the other side. The fourth person, who was neither a youth nor an old person, stood in front of him and inquired about the condition of the abscess and said that he would like to inspect it. He replied that the abscess was increasing by the day. Ismail thought that he had just cleaned himself and was going for the Ziyarat. He was wondering if he would lose his cleanliness if the person touched his abscess. He therefore refused to oblige. Now, the person strongly protested why he wasn’t willing to show them his abscess? Then the person bent low, pushed aside the garment from his thigh, held the abscess in his hands. Suddenly the pus gushed out from the abscess. He felt pain for a while, but was relieved soon thereafter.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Then the person put his hand over the area of the abscess and it looked completely cured. The person put back his garment in its place and said, “O Ismail! You are now fully healed!” He wondered who this person was? How could he know his name? He asked, puzzled and amazed, “How is it that you know me by name?!” The elderly person standing on his right said, “Ismail! Greet him! He is your Imam Mahdi (as)!” Ismail greeted the Imam (as). But replying to his greeting he swiftly mounted the steed and the four persons sped away from sight in no time!\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Ismail tried to sprint behind the horse of the Imam (as). For once the Imam (as) stopped his horse and asked him to turn back. He continued to run behind the Imam’s steed. He stopped a second time, and a third time when he said angrily, “O Ismail! I am your Imam-e-Zamana and I have asked you twice not to follow me! Even then in sheer disobedience you continued to follow us!”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Ismail was taken aback. He turned back towards Samarrah. It was early morning and people were stirring out of their homes. He asked them if they had seen the four persons speeding through the town on their steeds. They replied in the affirmative. Ismail asked them if they knew the four riders? They said that they didn’t know them, but their faces and attire indicated that they were not from that area. Then Ismail said that they had deprived themselves the opportunity of meeting Imam Zamana (as). People gathered around him and asked if he had been able to meet the Imam (as).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "He told them that he was visiting Samarrah seeking a cure for the abscess on his thigh. He informed them that the Imam (as) himself touched the abscess and it was instantly cured. The persons removed the cloth from his thigh to see if that was the case. They also inspected the other thigh. There wasn’t any sign if ever there was an abscess on any of his thighs. The persons snatched away small pieces of his garment to keep with themselves as a memento. They said that Ismail was the fortunate person, whose body was touched by the Imam (as). He went with difficulty to the inn, changed into a fresh garment and started for Baghdad.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "When he reached the Baghdad Bridge, he saw a wondrous scene. The story of his miraculous cure had preceded him and there was a huge crowd waiting for him on the bridge. Whenever any traveler reached the bridge, they would ask his name and then let him pass. Ismail didn’t know why they were asking the name of the new arrivals. When he told them that he was Ismail Harqali, they caught hold of him as was done by the men in Samarrah. It was almost a stampede and he was about to swoon and fall down. Then he noticed Sayyed Raziuddin Ibne Taaoos coming towards him with a big crowd following him. He asked the men to allow him some fresh air.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Hearing his admonition, the men moved away from Ismail. Sayyid Raziuddin caught hold of his shoulder and took him to his house in Baghdad. He told Ismail that the entire populace in Baghdad knew about his miraculous cure. Ismail related to him the entire episode. He told him that not only the story was correct, but the Imam (as) had sent a personal message for Sayyed Raziuddin. Sayyid Raziuddin immediately offered a prayer of thanksgiving and took him along to the caliph.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The caliph was a follower of the Ale Mohammed (as). Sayyid Raziuddin recounted the entire event to the vizier. The vizier informed about it to the caliph. The caliph called them immediately to his court and ordered all the eminent physicians of Baghdad to immediately report at the court. They all came there. The caliph asked them if they remembered Ismail who approached them some days ago for the treatment of the abscess on his thigh. They confirmed that they did inspect the abscess and also that they thought that it wasn’t possible to treat it. The only alternative was the amputation of the limb. The caliph asked, if the abscess had healed, what would have been the result? They replied that if the abscess really healed, it would leave an ugly mark on the spot for at least two months or more, which would then turn into a white mark that the person would carry for his entire life. Now, the caliph asked Ismail to move his garment from the spot where the abscess was. The physicians inspected it minutely and were surprised that there wasn’t any mark of the abscess there and the skin was as healthy as that of a normal person.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "One of the physicians was a Christian. He said that what happened could only be a miracle of Hazrat Isa (as). Now, the team of the physicians was sent away. The caliph wanted to give to Ismail a thousand Dinars as a gift, which he politely refused. The caliph was surprised why he was not accepting the gratuity. He said that the one, who cured him has ordered him not to accept any gift. Ismail now went back to the place of Sayyed Raziuddin Ibne Taaoos. He wrote a letter to Ali Ibne Owais, who sent to Ismail a purse containing 1,000 Dinars. When Ismail Harqali returned to his village, his son saw the thigh and was surprised that the abscess had totally disappeared and there was no mark left! Even hair had grown at that spot as it normally does.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Also his son, Shamsuddin narrated: After this incident, my father used to remain very sorrowful due to the separation. Thus, he used to go and stay in Baghdad during the whole of winter and travel to Samarrah and perform the Ziyarat. This year he performed Ziyarat for the fortieth time only in the hope that perhaps he gets the same chance again to see Imam Zamana  (as). But may Allah have mercy on him; he passed away this year with the hope that he will see the Imam again.");

        edetails.add("The reason of construction of Masjid Jamkaran was that that ShaykhAfifSaaleh Hasan bin MuthlaJamkarani says: It was the night of Tuesday, the seventeenth of the month of Ramazan 293 A.H. – and I was asleep in my house. A part of the night had passed. Some people came to my door and woke me up saying: Get up, SahibuzZamaan has summoned you. So I arose at once and said: All right, I\\’ll be there immediately. I picked up a shirt to put it on, but a voice came from inside the house: This is not your shirt. I put on another shirt; then reached for the Pajama; again a voice came that it was not mine. So I put it down and wore another. After that I started to search for the key, but a voice came: The door is already open. At last, Ireached the door to find many elders standing there. I greeted them; they replied and then conveyed me to the location where the Masjid stands today. At that place I decried a wooden platform covered by a very fine carpet. A mattress and pillows were also arranged on it and a young man of around thirty years was seated there. Before him was an elderly gentleman, reading from a book. Around sixty persons, some dressed in white and some in green, were busy praying. I learnt that the young man was HazratHujjat and the elderly gentleman was His Eminence, Khizr (a.s.). When I reached them, His Eminence, Khizr (a.s.) offered me a seat and HazratHujjat addressed me by my name and said: “Go to Hasan Muslim and tell him: You have put this land for your personal use since some years, and you try to cultivate crops on it, but we destroy them, in spite of that you do not desist. This year also you wanted to do the same. Now, you are not permitted to do so; and return whatever you have gained from this land, so that it can be utilized for building a Masjid on it. Tell him that this is an honored place and the Almighty Allah has bestowed it a special rank over other lands, which you are trying to include in your property. Your two adolescent sons passed away, but you did not heed the warnings. If you still don\\’t toe the line, you will be punished in such a way that you won\\’t know what hit you.” Hasan Maslah says: I said: My master, I would need a sign, as without it, no one would believe me. He said: We are leaving a sign here in order to verify your statements, you just convey the message. Go to Abul Hasan and ask him to recover from HasanMuslim the profits he had made in last few years and hand the money over to others so that construction may commence; and the remaining expenses can be taken from the agricultural income of our lands at Rahaq. We have endowed half of this rural property in favor of this Masjid. Announce it to the people that they should become inclined to it and be devoted to it. They should recite four units (rakats) of prayer in it: Two units (rakats) of prayer for honoring of Masjid: in each unit (rakat) of which they should recite Surah Hamd once and Surah Tauheed seven times; in Ruku and Sujood, they should recite the praises seven times. After that recite two units (rakats) of Prayer of Imam Zamaan (a.s.), in the following manner: Begin with Surah Hamd and when you come to IyyakaNa\\’bodowaiyyakaNaste\\’e\\’n, you should repeat this a hundred times and then proceed and complete Surah Hamd. The same method is to be followed in the second unit (rakat) as well. Repeat the Zikr seven times in Ruku and Sujood. After concluding the prayer, recite the Tahleel, e.g. Laaelaahaillallaahowahdahuwahdahu. And recite Tasbeeh Fatima Zahra (s.a.). After that prostrate and recite Salawat on Muhammad and Aale Muhammad (a.s.) in prostration a hundred times. After that the Imam\\’s words were as follows: If one recites the two prayers, it is as if he has prayed in the BaitulAteeq. After that Imam (a.s.) asked me to proceed. As soon as I started, he called me back and said: A goat is to be purchased from the flock of Ja\\’farKashani, the shepherd; if the villagers pay for it, well and good, if not, you pay for it yourself and slaughter it here tomorrow night. The following daywould be the 18th of month of Ramazan; on that day the mutton should be distributed among those who are ailing; Allah will cure those who eat from it. That goat is spotted, very hairy and having seven black and white marks the size of a dirham coin: three on one side and four on the other. Hasan bin Maslah says: After that I returned home and remained in deep thought all night. At last it was dawn. After prayers, I went to Ali bin Mundhir and narrated the whole incident to him. Then the two of us came to that same place and found in accordance to the statement of the Imam, chains and pegs, which were supposed to be the signs . After that we came to the place of SayyidAbul Hasan. The moment we reached his door, his servants said: The master is expecting you since dawn, are you a residents of Jamkaran? Then he was informed and I entered his place and greeted him with respect. He replied in a cordial way and offered me a seat near him. Before I could say anything, he started: O Hasan bin Maslah, last night I saw a gentleman in dream,who told me: Hasan bin Maslah, a resident of Jamkaran, will approach you in the morning. You must testify to whatever he says and rely on his words; his statement is our statement; you must not reject his words. I am waiting for you since I saw that dream. After that I narrated the incident in detail. Abul Hasan asked his men to saddle the horses. All of us mounted and set out from there. On reaching Jamkaran, we saw Ja\\’far with his herd at the side of the road. As I approached, a goat, which was at the rear, came bouncing to me. When I wanted to pay the cost to Ja\\’far, he swore that the goat did not belong to his herd. He said: I have never seen it before today and after that I was not able to catch it, no matter how much I tried. Thus, we brought that goat to the place that Imam (a.s.) had mentioned and slaughtered it there. Sayyid Abul Hasan summoned Hasan Muslim and the amount was recovered from him. Monies were also taken from the income of Rahaq village and the roof of the Masjid was completed. SayyidAbul Hasan carried those chains and pegs with him to Qom; they were kept at his home. Ailingpersons came and by Allah\\’s permission sought cure from them by rubbing them on their bodies. It is said that after the passing away of SayyidAbul Hasan, when his son fell ill, the case containing the chains and pegs was opened, but nothing was found in it .This, in brief, is the account of that place, which is mentioned there. The author says: In the Persian version of Taareekh Qom,and in its Arabic version, which the prominent scholar Agha Muhammad Ali Kermanshahi has mentioned this incident briefly in the marginal notes of Rejaal Mir Mustafa in the chapter of Hasas, the date of the incident is mentioned as 293 A.H. And apparently it was abrogated and the actual date was 273 A.H., which is the meaning of seventy, because the death of Shaykh Saduq was before 290 A.H.");

        etitle.add("Ismail bin Hasan Harqali is cured by Imam (a.s.)");
        esrc.add("Najmus Saqib Vol 1 chp 7 Pg 631");
        edetails.add("The accomplished scholar, Ali bin Isa Irbili says in Kashful Ghummah that: Some people informed me from my trusted friends that there was a person in Hilla known as Ismail bin Hasan Harqali from a village known as Harqal, who died during my time, but whom I did not have the chance to meet. His son, Shamsuddin narrated to me that his father said that an abscess came up on his left thigh and became as big as a fist. This abscess was there for a long time and it particularly gave him severe pain during the spring season. He used to lose a lot of blood through it. He said that he wasn\\’t able to properly offer his mandatory prayers because of the abscess. He worried so much about this that he went from his village to the town of Hilla. There he met Sayyid Raziuddin Ibne Taaoos, who was the most eminent scholar of the Shia during those days although he wasn\\’t recognized as their Pontiff, only, perhaps because he abstained from issuing edicts to the believers. Ismail Harqali met him and explained his problem to him. Sayyid Raziuddin called all the physicians of Hilla and sought their advice. They suggested that the only possible cure was the amputation of the abscessed limb. But they also said that there was great risk even in amputation, because there was the risk of severance of some vital veins in the process of amputation. The physicians were believer, and they didn\\’t want to give him careless advice. Sayyid Raziuddin told Ismail Harqali: “The Shariah gives permission to offer your prayers despite the impurity of the pus oozing from the abscess.” He said, in fact, prayers in such excruciating conditions will be doubly felicitous. Now, there was only one city, Baghdad, where there could perhaps be a possibility of his finding a cure. Baghdad was the capital of the realm of Islam and scholars of all disciplines were assembled there. Ismail Harqali thought that he must head for Baghdad. He met the personal physician of the Caliph and went to heavy expenses to take his treatment. He spent all his money, but the cure was not in sight. He had spent all his funds and was then subject to abject penury. He now thought that he would go and seek the help of the Imam Zamana (a.s.) in Samarrah. Therefore, he proceeded from Baghdad to Samarrah. For many days he continued to visit the Mausoleum of the Imams (a.s.) and also visited the cellar from where the Last Imam (a.s.) went into hiding. Although the cellar at Samarrah isn\\’t the abode of the Imam (a.s.), it is certainly associated with his memory. Many days went by when he thought that there was no hope of his recovery from the abscess and he was thinking of returning home disappointed. He thought that he had left his wife and children at home long enough and that he must go back to them. Therefore, the next morning, early with the sunrise, he went out of the ramparts of the city. Near the ramparts was flowing the river Tigris. He took a bath there and wanted to visit the mausoleums to bid adieu to the Imams (a.s.). He changed into a clean dress and carried water in apitcher for cleaning the abscess if it suppurated. This was as a caution for his entering the mausoleum in a clean state. As he entered the ramparts of the town, he found four persons cantering on horses towards him.Their personalities and garments were different from those of the Samarrans. He thought that they must be some travelers passing through the town. They came near him and suddenly stopped. Two of them were youths. They came and stood on his left. There was one elderly person who stood on the other side. The fourth person, who was neither a youth nor an old person, stood in front of him and inquired about the condition of the abscess and said that he would like to inspect it. He replied that the abscess was increasing by the day. Ismail thought that he had just cleaned himself and was going for the Ziyarat. He was wondering if he would lose his cleanliness if the person touched his abscess.He therefore refused to oblige. Now, the person strongly protested why he wasn\\’t willing to show them his abscess? Then the person bent low, pushed aside the garment from his thigh, held the abscess in his hands. Suddenly the pus gushed out from the abscess. He felt pain for a while, but was relieved soon thereafter. Then the person put his hand over thearea of the abscess and it looked completely cured. The person put back his garment in its place and said, “O Ismail! You are now fully healed!” He wondered who this person was? How could he know his name? He asked, puzzled and amazed, “How is it that you know me by name?!” The elderly person standing on his right said, “Ismail! Greet him! He is your Imam Zamana (a.s.)!” Ismail greeted the Imam (a.s.). But replying to his greeting he swiftly mounted the steed and the four persons sped away from sight in no time! Ismail tried to sprint behind the horse of the Imam (a.s.). For once the Imam (a.s.) stopped his horse and asked him to turn back. He continued to run behind the Imam\\’s steed. He stopped a second time, and a third time when he said angrily, “O Ismail! I am your Imam-e-Zamana and I have asked you twice not to follow me! Even then in sheer disobedience you continued to follow us!” Ismail was taken aback. He turned back towards Samarrah. It was early morning and people were stirring out of their homes. He asked them if they had seen the four persons speeding through the town on their steeds. They replied in the affirmative. Ismail asked them if they knew the four riders?They said that they didn\\’t know them, but their faces and attire indicated that they were not from that area. Then Ismail said that they had deprived themselves the opportunity of meeting Imam Zamana (a.s.). People gathered around him and asked if he had been able to meet the Imam (a.s.). He told them that he was visiting Samarrah seeking a cure for the abscess on his thigh. He informed them that the Imam (a.s.) himself touched the abscess and it was instantly cured. The persons removed the cloth from his thigh to see if that was the case. They also inspected the other thigh. There wasn\\’t any sign if ever there was an abscess on any of his thighs. The persons snatched away small pieces of his garment to keep with themselves as a memento. They said that Ismail was the fortunate person, whose body was touched by the Imam (a.s.). He went with difficulty to the inn, changed into a fresh garment and started for Baghdad. When he reached the Baghdad Bridge, he saw a wondrous scene. The story of his miraculous cure had preceded him and there was a huge crowd waiting for him on the bridge. Whenever any traveler reached the bridge, they would ask his name and then let him pass. Ismail didn\\’t know why theywere asking the name of the new arrivals. When he told them that he was Ismail Harqali, they caught hold of him as was done by the men inSamarrah. It was almost a stampede and he was about to swoon and fall down. Then he noticed Sayyid Raziuddin Ibne Taaoos coming towards him with a big crowd following him. He asked the men to allow him some fresh air. Hearing his admonition, the men moved away from Ismail. Sayyid Raziuddin caught hold of his shoulder and took him to his house in Baghdad. He told Ismail that the entire populace in Baghdad knew about his miraculous cure. Ismail related to him the entire episode. He told him that not only the story was correct, but the Imam (a.s.) had sent a personal message for Sayyid Raziuddin. Sayyid Raziuddin immediately offered a prayer of thanksgiving and took him along to the caliph. The caliph was a follower of the Aale Muhammad (s.a). Sayyid Raziuddin recounted the entire event to the vizier. The vizier informed about it to the caliph. The caliph called them immediately to his court and ordered all the eminent physicians of Baghdad to immediately report at the court. They all came there. The caliph asked them if they remembered Ismail who approached them some days ago for the treatment of the abscess on his thigh. They confirmed that they did inspect the abscess and also that they thought that it wasn\\’t possible to treat it. The only alternative was the amputation of the limb. The caliph asked, if the abscess had healed, what would have been the result? They replied that if the abscess really healed, it would leave an ugly mark on the spot for at least two months or more, which would then turn into a white mark that the person would carry for his entire life. Now, the caliph asked Ismail to move his garment from the spot where the abscess was. The physicians inspected it minutely and were surprised that there wasn\\’t any mark of the abscess there and the skin was as healthy as that of a normal person. One of the physicians was a Christian. He said that what happened could only be a miracle of Hazrat Isa (a.s.). Now, the team of the physicians was sent away. The caliph wanted to give to Ismail a thousand Dinars as a gift, which he politely refused. The caliph was surprised why he was not accepting the gratuity. He said that the one, who cured him has ordered him not to accept any gift. Ismail now went back to the place of Sayyid Raziuddin Ibne Taaoos. He wrote a letter to Ali IbneOwais, who sent to Ismail a purse containing 1,000 Dinars. When Ismail Harqali returned to his village, his son saw the thigh and was surprised that the abscess had totally disappeared and there was no mark left! Even hair had grown at that spot as it normally does. Ali bin Isa says: I asked Safiuddin Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Bashir Alawi Musawiand Najmuddin Haider Ibne Aisar about this incident. These two were my friends among the important personalities of that time and they had seen Ismail bin Hasan in that illness and healthyafter that and they testified it. Also his son, Shamsuddin narrated: After this incident, my father used to remain very sorrowful due to the separation. Thus, he used to go and stay in Baghdad during the whole of winter and travel to Samarrah and perform the Ziyarat.

        esrc.add("Najmus Saqib Vol 1 chp 7 Pg 639");
        edetails.add("This incident is very much similar to the previous one and it is that informed us the prominent and pious scholar, Mirza Muhammad Husain Naini Isfahani, the illustrious son of the practical scholar and cultured gentleman, Mirza Abdur Rahim Naini, entitled Shaykhul Islam, who is my full brother, whose name is Mirza Muhammad Saeed and who is presently studying in religious universities. Around the year 1285 he developed pain in his leg and swelling appeared at the back of the foot, where a blood clot rendered him unable to walk. They brought Mirza Ahmad the physician, son of Mirza Haji Abdul Wahhab Naini for his treatment and he treated him and his leg and foot were restored to health. Within a few days another abscess appeared between his knees and calf and after another few days another abscess appeared in his thigh and a third abscess between the shoulders; each of which became infected and were very painful. They festered and became full of puss. More than a year passed in that condition and all kinds of treatments were taken, but none provedeffective. On the contrary, the wounds continued to increase by the day and during this long time, he was unable to put his foot on the ground and they used to carry him from one place to another on shoulders. Because of the prolonged illness, his mood became weak and due to excess bleeding and puss he was reduced to a bundle of skin and bones and it became very difficult for the father as any treatment they adopted only worsened his wounds and weakened his condition further. The condition of his wounds worsened to such an extent that from the two abscesses one of them between thigh and the calf and the other one between the shoulders were such that if hand was passed over one of them, blood and puss seeped out from the other. During those days a severe epidemic appeared in Nain, and we took refuge from it in one of the villages. Thus, we were informed that an expert surgeon called Agha Yusuf was staying at a nearby village. So the father sent someone to him and called him for the cure and when my indisposed brother was brought before him for treatment, he was shocked for a moment till the father went out and I remained with him along with one of my uncles, Mirza Abdul Wahhab. He spoke to him in private for some time and we concluded from what we overheard that he was conveying themessage of despair to him and he was concealing it from me lest I should inform the mother. Then he became distressed and very much worried. Then the father returned. That surgeon said: I will take this much as advance and then I will begin the treatment and his aim was that the denial of the father would become an excuse for him to leave before starting the treatment. So, the father refused to pay any advance before the treatment and he got an opportunity and returned to his village. The father and mother knew that this was because the doctor was not having hope to treat the patient; and despite having such expertise, he has despaired. I had another uncle, Mirza Abu Talib who was very religious and was well known in the area, because he wrote letters addressed to Imam Zamana (a.s.) on behalf of people, which were very effective and people often contacted him during hardships and calamities. My mother requested him to write a letter seeking the help of the Imam to cure her son. He wrote it on Friday. The mother took it and taking my brother, went to a well near our village. My brother dropped that letter into the well and it remained suspended at the top of the well in the hands of the mother and this moved both of them and they wept intensely; and it was the last hour of Friday. After a few days, when I dreamt that three mounted menhave arrived in the form they had arrived in the incident of Ismail Harqali, from the desert and reached our place. In that condition I recalled the incident of Ismail and at that time I was aware of it and its details were in my knowledge. So, I noticed that the rider preceding them was Hazrat Hujjat (a.s.) and that the Imam had come to cure my brother. My brother was lying on his back or leaning on his bed as was his practice most of the time. Hazrat Hujjat (a.t.f.s.) approached with a spear which he passed over his body and said: Get up, as your uncle has returned from the journey. In this way, I realized that Imam (a.s.) implied another uncle of ours, Haji Mirza Ali Akbar, who had gone on a business trip since a long time and we were worried about him because of the delay due to the changing times and severe famine. When the Imam passed the spear on his shoulder and uttered that statement, my brother woke up and hastened to the door to welcome that uncle. After I awoke, I saw that it was morning and the atmosphere was lit up and no one had risen up for the Morning Prayers. I rose up in haste and went to my brother before putting on my clothes. I woke him up and said: Hazrat Hujjat (a.s.) has cured you; you may get up. I took his hand and made him stand up. My mother woke up and cried: Why are you waking him? He was awake most of the night due to pain and a little more sleep will be good for him. I said: Hazrat Hujjat (a.s.) has cured him. When I made him stand up, he started walking around the room and though he was unable to stand up since a year or more and was carried from one place to another by others. This incident was publicized in that village and all relatives and acquaintances came to see him as they could not believe it. I narrated the dream to them and I was pleased that I made haste to narrate about the cure while he was asleep and the blood and puss stopped that day and his wounds were cured within a week. After some days our uncle arrived safe and sound and on this date, which is year 1303 and all the persons mentioned in this story are alive, except my mother and the surgeon, who passed away. And praise be to Allah. Letter of entreaty to the Imam of the Time (a.s.) The author says: Letter of entreaty to the Imam of the Time (a.s.) is narrated in a number of ways and is present in many books of general supplications; but I came across a version, which is not mentioned there. On the contrary, it is not even quoted in Mazaar Behaarul Anwaar and the book of supplications of Behaarul Anwaar. Since its copy is rare we found it necessary to mention it here. Prominent scholar, Muhammad bin Muhammad Tayyib, a scholar of Safavid rule, in his book of Aneesul Aabedeen, which Allamah Majlisi in Behaarul Anwaar and the learned scholar, Mirza Abdullah Isfahani has narrated in Saheefah Saalesa, from the book of Saadaat the text of Dua Tawassul for every important matter and need. In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful I make as a medium, O Abal Qasim Muhammad bin Hasan bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ali bin Moosa bin Ja\\’far bin Muhammad bin Ali Ibnul Husain bin Ali Ibne Abi Talib (a.s.) for the great news and the straight path and the infallibility of refuge-giver, by your mother, chief of the ladies of the world and through your purified forefathers and by your purified mothers; by Yasin and the wise Quran and the great power and the reality of faith and the light of the lights and the hidden book that you be the envoys to the Almighty Allah in the need of so and so or destroy so and so. And this letter is placed in pure clay and dropped in flowing water or a well saying: O Saeed bin Usmaan or O Usmaan bin Saeed convey my request to the master of the age (a.s.). The version was like this, but in view of some traditional reports and method mentioned in some letters, it should be as follows: O Usmaan bin Saeed and O Muhammad bin Usmaan…and so on and Allah knows best");

        esrc.add(" Najmus Saqib Vol 1 chp 7 Pg 644");
        edetails.add("The accomplished scholar, Ali bin Isa Irbili says in Kashful Ghummah that: Some people informed me from my trusted friends that there was a person in Hilla known as Ismail bin Hasan Harqali from a village known as Harqal, who died during my time, but whom I did not have the chance to meet. His son, Shamsuddin narrated to me that his father said that an abscess came up on his left thigh and became as big as a fist. This abscess was there for a long time and it particularly gave him severe pain during the spring season. He used to lose a lot of blood through it. He said that he wasn\\’t able to properly offer his mandatory prayers because of the abscess. He worried so much about this that he went from his village to the town of Hilla. There he met Sayyid Raziuddin Ibne Taaoos, who was the most eminent scholar of the Shia during those days although he wasn\\’t recognized as their Pontiff, only, perhaps because he abstained from issuing edicts to the believers. Ismail Harqali met him and explained his problem to him. Sayyid Raziuddin called all the physicians of Hilla and sought their advice. They suggested that the only possible cure was the amputation of the abscessed limb. But they also said that there was great risk even in amputation, because there was the risk of severance of some vital veins in the process of amputation. The physicians were believer, and they didn\\’t want to give him careless advice. Sayyid Raziuddin told Ismail Harqali: “The Shariah gives permission to offer your prayers despite the impurity of the pus oozing from the abscess.” He said, in fact, prayers in such excruciating conditions will be doubly felicitous. Now, there was only one city, Baghdad, where there could perhaps be a possibility of his finding a cure. Baghdad was the capital of the realm of Islam and scholars of all disciplines were assembled there. Ismail Harqali thought that he must head for Baghdad. He met the personal physician of the Caliph and went to heavy expenses to take his treatment. He spent all his money, but the cure was not in sight. He had spent all his funds and was then subject to abject penury. He now thought that he would go and seek the help of the Imam Zamana (a.s.) in Samarrah. Therefore, he proceeded from Baghdad to Samarrah. For many days he continued to visit the Mausoleum of the Imams (a.s.) and also visited the cellar from where the Last Imam (a.s.) went into hiding. Although the cellar at Samarrah isn\\’t the abode of the Imam (a.s.), it is certainly associated with his memory. Many days went by when he thought that there was no hope of his recovery from the abscess and he was thinking of returning home disappointed. He thought that he had left his wife and children at home long enough and that he must go back to them. Therefore, the next morning, early with the sunrise, he went out of the ramparts of the city. Near the ramparts was flowing the river Tigris. He took a bath there and wanted to visit the mausoleums to bid adieu to the Imams (a.s.). He changed into a clean dress and carried water in apitcher for cleaning the abscess if it suppurated. This was as a caution for his entering the mausoleum in a clean state. As he entered the ramparts of the town, he found four persons cantering on horses towards him.Their personalities and garments were different from those of the Samarrans. He thought that they must be some travelers passing through the town. They came near him and suddenly stopped. Two of them were youths. They came and stood on his left. There was one elderly person who stood on the other side. The fourth person, who was neither a youth nor an old person, stood in front of him and inquired about the condition of the abscess and said that he would like to inspect it. He replied that the abscess was increasing by the day. Ismail thought that he had just cleaned himself and was going for the Ziyarat. He was wondering if he would lose his cleanliness if the person touched his abscess.He therefore refused to oblige. Now, the person strongly protested why he wasn\\’t willing to show them his abscess? Then the person bent low, pushed aside the garment from his thigh, held the abscess in his hands. Suddenly the pus gushed out from the abscess. He felt pain for a while, but was relieved soon thereafter. Then the person put his hand over thearea of the abscess and it looked completely cured. The person put back his garment in its place and said, “O Ismail! You are now fully healed!” He wondered who this person was? How could he know his name? He asked, puzzled and amazed, “How is it that you know me by name?!” The elderly person standing on his right said, “Ismail! Greet him! He is your Imam Zamana (a.s.)!” Ismail greeted the Imam (a.s.). But replying to his greeting he swiftly mounted the steed and the four persons sped away from sight in no time! Ismail tried to sprint behind the horse of the Imam (a.s.). For once the Imam (a.s.) stopped his horse and asked him to turn back. He continued to run behind the Imam\\’s steed. He stopped a second time, and a third time when he said angrily, “O Ismail! I am your Imam-e-Zamana and I have asked you twice not to follow me! Even then in sheer disobedience you continued to follow us!” Ismail was taken aback. He turned back towards Samarrah. It was early morning and people were stirring out of their homes. He asked them if they had seen the four persons speeding through the town on their steeds. They replied in the affirmative. Ismail asked them if they knew the four riders?They said that they didn\\’t know them, but their faces and attire indicated that they were not from that area. Then Ismail said that they had deprived themselves the opportunity of meeting Imam Zamana (a.s.). People gathered around him and asked if he had been able to meet the Imam (a.s.). He told them that he was visiting Samarrah seeking a cure for the abscess on his thigh. He informed them that the Imam (a.s.) himself touched the abscess and it was instantly cured. The persons removed the cloth from his thigh to see if that was the case. They also inspected the other thigh. There wasn\\’t any sign if ever there was an abscess on any of his thighs. The persons snatched away small pieces of his garment to keep with themselves as a memento. They said that Ismail was the fortunate person, whose body was touched by the Imam (a.s.). He went with difficulty to the inn, changed into a fresh garment and started for Baghdad. When he reached the Baghdad Bridge, he saw a wondrous scene. The story of his miraculous cure had preceded him and there was a huge crowd waiting for him on the bridge. Whenever any traveler reached the bridge, they would ask his name and then let him pass. Ismail didn\\’t know why theywere asking the name of the new arrivals. When he told them that he was Ismail Harqali, they caught hold of him as was done by the men inSamarrah. It was almost a stampede and he was about to swoon and fall down. Then he noticed Sayyid Raziuddin Ibne Taaoos coming towards him with a big crowd following him. He asked the men to allow him some fresh air. Hearing his admonition, the men moved away from Ismail. Sayyid Raziuddin caught hold of his shoulder and took him to his house in Baghdad. He told Ismail that the entire populace in Baghdad knew about his miraculous cure. Ismail related to him the entire episode. He told him that not only the story was correct, but the Imam (a.s.) had sent a personal message for Sayyid Raziuddin. Sayyid Raziuddin immediately offered a prayer of thanksgiving and took him along to the caliph. The caliph was a follower of the Aale Muhammad (s.a). Sayyid Raziuddin recounted the entire event to the vizier. The vizier informed about it to the caliph. The caliph called them immediately to his court and ordered all the eminent physicians of Baghdad to immediately report at the court. They all came there. The caliph asked them if they remembered Ismail who approached them some days ago for the treatment of the abscess on his thigh. They confirmed that they did inspect the abscess and also that they thought that it wasn\\’t possible to treat it. The only alternative was the amputation of the limb. The caliph asked, if the abscess had healed, what would have been the result? They replied that if the abscess really healed, it would leave an ugly mark on the spot for at least two months or more, which would then turn into a white mark that the person would carry for his entire life. Now, the caliph asked Ismail to move his garment from the spot where the abscess was. The physicians inspected it minutely and were surprised that there wasn\\’t any mark of the abscess there and the skin was as healthy as that of a normal person. One of the physicians was a Christian. He said that what happened could only be a miracle of Hazrat Isa (a.s.). Now, the team of the physicians was sent away. The caliph wanted to give to Ismail a thousand Dinars as a gift, which he politely refused. The caliph was surprised why he was not accepting the gratuity. He said that the one, who cured him has ordered him not to accept any gift. Ismail now went back to the place of Sayyid Raziuddin Ibne Taaoos. He wrote a letter to Ali IbneOwais, who sent to Ismail a purse containing 1,000 Dinars. When Ismail Harqali returned to his village, his son saw the thigh and was surprised that the abscess had totally disappeared and there was no mark left! Even hair had grown at that spot as it normally does. Ali bin Isa says: I asked Safiuddin Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Bashir Alawi Musawiand Najmuddin Haider Ibne Aisar about this incident. These two were my friends among the important personalities of that time and they had seen Ismail bin Hasan in that illness and healthyafter that and they testified it. Also his son, Shamsuddin narrated: After this incident, my father used to remain very sorrowful due to the separation. Thus, he used to go and stay in Baghdad during the whole of winter and travel to Samarrah and perform the Ziyarat. This year he performed Ziyarat for the fortieth time only in the hope that perhaps he gets the same chance again to see Imam Zamana(a.s.). But may Allah have mercy on him; he passed away this year with the hope that he will see the Imam again.

The physicians inspected it minutely and were surprised that there wasn\\’t any mark of the abscess there and the skin was as healthy as that of a normal person. One of the physicians was a Christian. He said that what happened could only be a miracle of Hazrat Isa (a.s.). Now, the team of the physicians was sent away. The caliph wanted to give to Ismail a thousand Dinars as a gift, which he politely refused. The caliph was surprised why he was not accepting the gratuity. He said that the one, who cured him has ordered him not to accept any gift. Ismail now went back to the place of Sayyid Raziuddin Ibne Taaoos. He wrote a letter to Ali IbneOwais, who sent to Ismail a purse containing 1,000 Dinars. When Ismail Harqali returned to his village, his son saw the thigh and was surprised that the abscess had totally disappeared and there was no mark left! Even hair had grown at that spot as it normally does. Ali bin Isa says: I asked Safiuddin Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Bashir Alawi Musawiand Najmuddin Haider Ibne Aisar about this incident. These two were my friends among the important personalities of that time and they had seen Ismail bin Hasan in that illness and healthyafter that and they testified it. Also his son, Shamsuddin narrated: After this incident, my father used to remain very sorrowful due to the separation. Thus, he used to go and stay in Baghdad during the whole of winter and travel to Samarrah and perform the Ziyarat. This year he performed Ziyarat for the fortieth time only in the hope that perhaps he gets the same chance again to see Imam Zamana(a.s.). But may Allah have mercy on him; he passed away this year with the hope that he will see the Imam again. The author says: Shaykh Hurre Amili, in the book of Amalul Amal says: Shaykh Muhammad bin Ismail and Hasan bin Abul Hasan bin Ali Harqali, accomplished scholar, was a student of the Allamah and I have seen different books in hishand writing from whom it is clear that they werewritten during the time of the author and were read before him or his son, Fakhrul Muhaqqaqin… This humble author is aware of two copies of the Sharai, which are mentioned to be in the handwriting of Shaykh Muhammad; one of them is having a single volume and in the view of Mohaqqiq Awal and Mohaqqiq Saani and permission of both the gentlemen is mentioned in it and presently in the city of Kazmain it is present with the noble scholar Sayyid Muhammad Aale Sayyid Haider (d.a.) and it is mentioned on the back: Completed inscribing the book, the humble servant needful of divine mercy, Muhammad bin Ismail bin Hasan bin Abil Hasan bin Ali Harqali, may Allah forgive him, his parents and the all men and women. On the last morning of Thursday, 15thRamazan, 670 A.H. by the praise of the Almighty Allah and praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds and Allah is sufficient a helper. The humble slave, Muhammad bin Ismail bin Hasan bin Abul Hasan bin Ali Harqali concluded writing this letter (may Allah have mercy on him, his parents and on the believers) at the last part of Thursday 15th Ramazan, year 670 A.H. And praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. Allah is sufficient for us and the best of the executors. The letter of Mohaqqiq regarding him is as follows: Indeed he may Allah help him by way of teaching, discussion and research in the gatherings of its last four assemblies on 18th Zilhajj of the year 671 A.H. by our master and chief Ameerul Momineen Ali Ibne Abi Talib (a.s.) – Ja\\’far bin Saeed. And the permission of Mohaqqiq Saani at the back of the first volume for Shaykh Sharafuddin Qasim bin Haji, famous as Ibne Hazafa in the year 933 and his writing is present at the end of the first and second volume; and this author is having another version by divine grace in two volumes and it was read out before Mohaqqiq Saani, Ibne Fahd and ShaykhYahya Mufti Karkietc. And all the letters are present in it and most of the marginal notes in it are in the writing of IbneFahd.");

        edetails.add("In the book of Najmus Saqib, there is an incident narrated about Shaykh Mohammed Taher Najafi, The Shaykh served with Masjid Kufa for many years and was staying there along with his family. He was a very pious and God fearing person. Towards the latter part of his life, he became blind. Some of the scholars have narrated his incident as follows. A few years ago a fight erupted between two tribes in the city of Najaf. Due to this war-like situation, the scholars and visitors to Najaf were unable to travel to Masjid Kufa. It was for quite some time, that in the city of Najaf, the hotels with which I was associated were not seeing any pilgrims due to the wars. Even the scholars were not coming to Najaf. At this, I became very worried as I had a large family to support. There was an added responsibility of some orphans on me also. Things were getting very difficult and I was living a hand to mouth existence. On one Shabe\\’ Jamuah it so happened that there was nothing to eat at all. My children were crying due to hunger. At this time, my heart was very sad. I left my house and began walking and narrating my condition to Allah. I said – O Allah! I am satisfied with my condition and whatever you have ordained for me. But what should I do – I have yet to be blessed with a visit of my master Imam Mahdi (as). If you grant me permission to see the honourable face of my master (as), I promise that I will never ask you for anything else ever again and will be happy and satisfied with the poverty that you have destined for me. Suddenly, I got up from my place. I saw a white cloth my hand (this cloth was one which people normally place at the place of prostration in namaz). My other hand was in the hand of a handsome and awesome youth. His strong personality and striking features gave me the impression that he was some emperor. My mind was in a daze and I did not know what is happening. Then I saw that he had worn a green turban and a person dressed in white clothes was standing next to him. We started walking towards the mehraab (prayer niche) in the mosque. When we reached there, the person who had taken hold of my hand turned to me and said, O Taher, spread the cloth for namaz. I spread the cloth. It was the whitest cloth I had ever seen and was outstandingly beautiful, but I could not make out the material with which it had been made. As I laid out the cloth and turned it towards the Qiblah, this handsome Sayyed stood stood on it and began reciting his namaz. I was mesmerized by his presence and slowly the radiance (noor) from his face increased so much that it was difficult to look at his face directly. His companion too stood behind him and got busy in reciting his prayers. I stood ahead of them and was watching them. Who are these persons, I wondered? When they had completed their prayers, I saw that the person who was praying behind was no longer with us. Before I could absorb this, I became aware of a chair, which was about 4 feet in height and even had a shade attached to it. The respected Sayyed who was praying ahead on the white cloth was sitting on it. The illumination from the chair and the face of this person was making it difficult for my eyes to see. The respected Sayyed said, O Taher, which emperor do you take me for? I said, O Master, you are the emperor of emperors. You are a leader in knowledge and are not like the other kings. Then he said, O Taher, you have succeeded in your objective (of meeting Imam Mahdi (as)). What do you wish now? Do we not take care of you needs everyday? Are your deeds not presented before us? Finally the respected sayyed promised me that my condition and wealth would improve and that I would never face poverty again. At that time, a sinful person, who I knew by name and character entered Masjid Kufa from the direction of the shrine of Hazrat Muslim Ibne Aqeel (as). Suddenly I saw that the holy face of Imam was seized with anger. He turned his face towards that person and said, Till where will you run and escape? Is not the earth and heaven our kingdom? Follow the orders which we have issued, for you have no choice. Then he turned towards me, smiled and said, You have fulfilled your desires. Now do you want anything else? I was so dumbstruck by his magnificence and brilliance that I could not speak up. He repeated his question and again I was in such a state that I could not reply. I was unable to express my happiness in words. Then within a flash, I saw that I was alone in the mosque and that Imam Mahdi (as) had disappeared. I looked towards the east and saw that morning was almost upon me. After this, the Shaykh says that the doors of sustenance were opened to him and he never faced the shortage of anything in my life");

Ayatollah Mohammed Taqi Najafi Isfahani has also brought many benefits of the verse of Quran in his book – ‘Special Signs\\’. The book “Masjid-e-Jamkaran” narrates an incident about Aqa Hussain who was a driver. He says that he lost his mother in his childhood following which his father remarried. He was unhappy with this arrangement and so he ran away from Iraq, his homeland and learnt driving. Over a period of time, he even learnt some mechanical aspects and started working in the workshop of a Jew. During this period he developed a severe pain in his back and this was causing him a lot of trouble. He met many doctors for its treatment but no medicines were beneficial for it. He took a lot of x-rays and even met doctors outside Iran for its treatment. He even had an operation for his back. But the more he struggled for its treatment, the more he became convinced that this pain would not go away. Finally the doctors told him that the area of his back had become weak and hence any treatment for the pain was useless. He finally traveled to the Masjid of Jamkaran in Qum and sought the help of Imam Mahdi (as) that he may be delivered from this pain. He stayed there for some days in a hotel, but it was of no use and he returned back to Qum. That night he saw a dream in which someone told him that if you wish to get your desires fulfilled you must spend less time at the hotel and the nights remaining awake in the mosque! He went again to Jamkaran mosque. This time he intended that in the month of Rajab he would perform the prayers of the mosque of Jamkaran. That night he was alone in the mosque. There was no one with him. When he completed his prayers, he saw a respectful person in a green dress who had a halo of light around him enter the mosque and sat down. At that time, his back was aching severely and he was in great difficulty. The Sayyed turned towards him and said, Where do you feel the pain? He replied, For quite some time I am having severe pain in my back. The Sayyed came closer to him and put his noble hands on the spine and rubbed it with his palm. Then he slowly started rubbing his palm over each bone in the spine and as he massaged the back, he kept on reciting the last four verses of Surah Hashr. Then the Sayyed said, You have been cured. He moved his back a little but could not feel any pain. He then moved his body a little more to the right and left, but found that the pain had vanished completely. He got up and walked a little, even ran in the compound of the mosque, but could feel no pain! There was a big stone lying outside the mosque. He picked it up and raised it above his head – no pain! He tested his back with different positions and exercises and found it to be strong and healthy. He went inside the mosque to thank this Sayyed but could find no sign of him. He realised that the Sayyed was Imam Mahdi (as). He looked all over for him but the Sayyed had disappeared completely.");

Imam Jafar Sadiq (as) and I had a small discussion which I am unable to remember now, but what I do remember clearly is that the Holy Prophet (sawa) prayed to Allah in my favour.

       edetails.add("Janab Mustataab Taqi Saleh Sayyed Ahmed ibne Hashim ibne Sayyed Musawi Rashti was a businessman living in the city of Rasht in Iran. This incident about his meeting with Imam Mahdi (as) is narrated by him as follows.I decided to perform Hajj in the year 1280 AH. With this intention I travelled from Rasht to Tabriz. At Tabriz, I stayed at the house of Haji Safar Ali who was himself a famous businessman of Tabriz. There I was very worried and anxious because at that time there was no caravan, which was to depart to Makkah for Hajj. I did not know what to do. I became ready to depart from Tabriz for Tarabuzan with Haji Jabbar Jaludaar Isfahani. We agreed on the fare for journey and departed from Tabriz. At the house of Haji Safar Ali, there were 3 other men whose names were Mulla Baqer Tabrizi, Haaj Sayyed Husain Tabrizi and Haaj Ali. They too joined me in this journey. We departed together, crossed the country of Rome towards Tarabuzan. During the journey, Haji Jabbar came close to me and said, The road that we are about to cross is a dangerous one. It is better if we cross it quickly so that we can join the caravan that is ahead.” So we all began travelling faster with the intention of catching up with the caravan ahead of us. We had hardly walked some distance that it began snowing heavily. It was dark and visibility was poor. My companions covered their heads and continued to move quickly. I tried my best to keep up with them, but in this weather it was difficult for me and soon they had gone ahead and I was left alone. I got down from my horse and sat down on one side of the road. I was in a state of helplessness and dejection. I was carrying only about 600 Tumans, which I had kept with me for the journey. Finally I decided to spend the night there and continue my journey in the morning. As we had not travelled very far from the city, there was a possibility for me to turn back and select a few strong men with me as my companions and renew my effort to catch up with the caravan. I was deliberating over this option when suddenly I saw a garden on the opposite side of the road and its gardener. It seemed that there was a shovel in his hand with which he was clearing the snow from the branches of the trees in the garden. This person came closer to me and stood at a distance and asked me in Persian, Who are you? I told him that my companions had gone ahead and that I was new in this area and did not know the way. He said to me, “Pray the Nafilah (recommended) prayers so that you may find the road.” I readied myself for prayers and recited the night prayers (Namaz Shab). After I completed my prayers, he came to me again and said, “You are still here? Why haven\\’t you left yet?” I said, “By Allah, I promise that I do not know the way.” He said, Recite Ziyarat Jameah. I did not know Ziyarat Jameah by heart and even at that time I knew that I would not be able to complete it. Yet I began reciting it and soon I found that I had recited it completely without any mistake. As I completed the Ziyarat, the gardener came to me again and said, “You are still here? Why are you sitting here?” I began crying uncontrollably and said, “Yes, I am still here. I do not know the way or else I would have left.” He said, “Recite Ziyarat Ashurah.” I got up and began reciting it. I did not Ziyarat Ashurah by heart and even at that time I knew that I would not be able to complete it. Yet I began reciting it and soon I found that I had recited it completely with the 100 salaams and 100 curses without any mistake. I even recited Dua Alqamah which is to be recited after Ziyarat Ashurah. After I completed the recitation, he came to me again and said, “You are still here? Why haven\\’t you left yet?” I said, “I will be here at least till the morning.” He said, “Wait, I will reach you to your destination.” He mounted a donkey, hauled the shovel on this shoulder and asked me to climb behind him on the donkey\\’s back. I complied with his request. At this time, I tugged at the reins of my horse, but he did not move from his place. The gardener said, “Give me the reins of the horse.” I gave them to him. He shifted the shovel to his left shoulder and began walking. Surprisingly, the horse began to move along with him. While walking, he placed his hand on my thigh and said, “Why don\\’t you pray Namaz Shab”. Then he repeated thrice, “Nafilah, Nafilah, Nafilah!” Then he said, “Why don\\’t you recite Ziyarat Ashurah?” Then he repeated thrice for emphasis, “Ashurah, Ashurah, Ashurah!” Then he said, “Why don\\’t you recite Ziyarat Jameah?” Then he repeated thrice for emphasis, ” Jameah, Jameah, Jameah!” Thus in this way, he reminded me about these three actions. Suddenly he turned to me and said, “Look there are your friends”. I saw my companions in the distance. They had stopped at the river and were performing ablution for their morning namaz. I got down from the donkey and moved towards my horse so that I may reach them. I had hardly reached my horse that I saw the gardener. He had got down from the donkey and was waiting to help me mount my horse. He turned the face of the horse in the direction of my friends. At this point a few thought began racing through my mind. Who was this person? Firstly, he had been speaking to me in Persian in an area where the language was not spoken. The people in the area were Turkish and followed the Christian religion, and apart from them there was no other person in this area. Secondly, he had asked me to recite Nafilah, Ziyarat Jameah and Ziyarat Ashurah. Thirdly, despite the fact that I had waited for so long at that place, he was able to reach me to my companions in a very short time! Finally I reached the conclusion that this gardener was none other than Imam Mahdi (as). However when I turned behind to address him, I could not see anyone. In fact there was no sign at all of any person having been there.");

He rubbed my hands over my wounds after which I saw that my wounds had healed. He asked me to wait there and disappeared for some time. When he returned, I saw that he had the head of my enemy in his hands and also his horse was with him. He said, This is the head of your enemy. You have helped us and we have helped you. Allah helps those who help Him. I said, please tell me who are you. He said I am so and so, implying he was Imam Mahdi (as). While leaving he said, whenever any person asks you about this wound, you say that it is the wound of Siffeen.");

He used to say that he had only one dua from Allah which he used to recite frequently at every place, even in the shrine of Hazrat Ameerul Momeneen Ali (as) and the dua was that he should get the opportunity to meet Imam Mahdi (as).He says that I used to plead and frequently recite these sentences from Dua Ahad – Allahumma Arinit Tal\\’atar Rasheedah, Wal Ghurrratal Hameedah (O Allah, (please do) show me his magnificent appearance and his praiseworthy forehead; delight my eyes by letting me have a look at him…) Once it so happened that he was afflicted by tuberculosis (TB). While he was extremely poor, he had a high sense of independence and self respect due to which he would not speak about his condition to any person. Hence, ordinarily, people would not come to know of happenings in his life. His disease progressed till such time that when he coughed, blood would come out. Due to this, he was put in a small common room so that if he coughed blood, it would not soil a good room. For many days, he remained in this room and his treatment continued. However there was no improvement in his condition and whenever he coughed, blood continued to emerge so much so that people became hopeless about his cure. They did not expect that he would ever be cured from this dangerous disease. However after some days, the news became common amongst the people that he has been cured completely. This news stumped the people since his disease had progressed so much that people were no having any hope that he would be cured. The question on everyone\\’s lips was how did he get cured? This seems to be the work of some invisible force since it was not possible for any ordinary person to cure him. People began visiting him and questioning him about his miraculous recovery. Shaykh Mohammed Taqi replied, One night, my condition worsened such that I was not having the strength to breath leave aside the strength to move. I was not in my senses and in this way, the night progressed slowly till such time that the whiteness of the morning was visible in the horizon. Suddenly I saw that a man entered the roof of the house. He was carrying a chair which he placed in front of me. Hardly some moments had passed that another person entered the roof and sat on the chair. At that moment, I became aware that the person is Hazrat Ameerul Momeneen Ali Ibne Abi Talib (as). He (as) turned towards me and said, how is your health? I replied, O my master and lord! I desire that I should be cured of this disease and that I should be relieved of my life of poverty. He (as) replied, as regards your disease, you are cured. Now you have no illness. I said, , O my master and lord! What about my dua which I recited every morning and evening in your mausoleum? He replied, tomorrow before the sun rises, come to so and so place in Wadi-Us-Salaam. When you reach the place, sit down on the road which comes from Karbala. At that time, my son Hazrat Imam Mahdi (as) (as) will come from Karbala. He will be accompanied by two companions. Convey salutations to him and follow him wherever he goes. Thereafter I returned to my senses and saw that there was no one there. At that time, I thought I was hallucinating or that I must have seen this vision in a dream. However when I saw that I had not coughed for quite some time and basically, I felt quite well. I was amazed that I had been completely cured. The entire day passed and night fell, yet I had not coughed at all. Now I began to think that if the promise of Ameerul Momeneen (as) comes true then it will be a great fortune for me. At morning, before sun rise, I reached the place which Hazrat (as) had directed me to. I turned in the direction of the road from Karbala and sat there. I waited there at the peak of my anticipation for meeting with my master when suddenly I saw three men coming along the road. One of these men walked ahead of the others with a regal demeanour. When I saw this scene, I was overcome by such awe that when they came close to me, I was unable to say anything else other than salaam. They continued walking along the wall of the city which leads to the special place of Imam Mahdi (as). When we reached there, the Sayyed entered the room and sat at a special place. The other two men stood silently at the door of the room. I too stood next to them till such time that the sun arose. I could control myself further. I began thinking in my mind – let me enter and kiss the feet of my master Imam Mahdi (as). As soon as I entered the room, I saw that there was no one there. I was stunned at this scene. It was as if the entire world became dark for a couple of moments. When I came to my senses, I searched all over for him, but I could not find him.");

        edetails.add("The late Sayyed Ali Shustari narrates – It was a regular practice that on special occasions, Shaykh Murtuza Ansari and myself used to travel from Najaf Ashraf to Karbala for Ziyarat and stay there for some days.On one such occasion, we stayed in Karbala for three days. On the last night, Shaykh Murtuza Ansari said, let us return to Najaf tomorrow. I said okay. More than half the night had passed when I awoke suddenly. I saw the Shaykh performed ablution and after wearing his dress and turban, left the house. I thought that perhaps he is under the impression that it is morning and it is time to leave whereas it was just over midnight and the time for Namaz Shab had not yet set in. I was thinking about this when he had crossed the courtyard. I was curious to know where he was going at this time of the night. I thought that I should follow him. Therefore, I quickly put on my robes and silently started following him so that he would not be aware of my presence. He walked quickly through the streets of Karbala till such time that he came close to a door which was famous as “Baghdad.” There was a small house at this door. Shaykh Murtuza stood before this house. I too stopped at a distance and started observing him. I saw that he stood before the door and conveyed Salaams to someone. A person replied to his salaams in a beautiful voice from inside the house. Shaykh Murtuza said, I intend to leave tomorrow. Do I have your permission? A voice from the house said, have you completed the work? He replied, no. The voice said, Then stay here. Don\\’t go tomorrow. Shaykh Murtuza said, I submit myself to your command. Saying this, he left from there. When I saw him turning, I swiftly turned from there and ran home and lay down on my bed so that he would not know of my activity. As morning approached, we busied ourselves in Quran, namaz and supplications. Thereafter, I said, we have to leave for Najaf. Let us get ready for the journey. Shaykh Murtuza said, not today. We will go tomorrow. I remained silent and deliberately did not seek any further explanation from him. In this way, the day passed and evening set in. I was intrigued to know the reason for this strange episode. Just the previous day, Shaykh Murtuza had indicated his intention to leave Karbala, then in the middle of the night, all by himself, he had performed ablution and gone to a place where after conveying salaams, he had sought permission from someone to leave. I could not understand who was this person and why was permission sought from him. Finally, I decided that I would remain awake and see how this episode unfolds, what would happen tonight and where he will go. When it was time to sleep, I lay down on my bed, but remained awake. At exactly the same time as the previous night, Shaykh Ansari got up from his bed silently so that he would not disturb me. He put on his clothes, performed ablution and quietly left the house. As soon as he left, I got up from the bed and started following him silently. I saw that he took the same route as the previous night till he came to the same house and stood before its door and conveyed salaams. A person replied to the salaams from inside the house. Then Shaykh Ansari said, do you permit me to leave tomorrow? In reply, the voice said, have you completed the work? The Shaykh said, yes Sir, I have completed the work. In reply, the person said, yes, you have my permission. You can leave. Shaykh Murtuza turned to return to our house. I quickly came back to the house before him and lay down on the bed as if I had never moved from there. He came to our house and slept contentedly. The next day, we left Najaf Ashraf as decided. When we had left the city gates and entered into the jungle area, I turned to him and said, I wanted to ask you two questions. He said, yes, go on.

(referring to the person who Shaykh Ansari was meeting in the night) Shaykh Ansari said, who are you referring to? I replied, I am referring to our Master and leader who was in the house. I want to let you know that I am aware of the happenings; I only wanted to understand what is this secret? Shaykh Ansari asked me lot of questions to verify that indeed I was aware of the entire episode. Then I said, my question is that on the first night, when you sought permission to leave, the Imam (as) asked you about a work which you had not done. On the second night, he asked you again when you sought permission to leave. This time, you affirmed that you had completed the work. What was this work? Shaykh Ansari said that I cannot disclose this to you. It is a secret. Despite my insistence, he did not disclose the secret to me. He also took a promise from me that I would not disclose this episode to any person in his lifetime. I remained true to this promise and did not speak to any person about this incident till he was alive.");

While walking, when he had completed half the distance to his destination, he fell short of the money which he had carried with himself for expenses. He did not have enough money to either return home or to continue the journey. He was distressed and troubled over his poor condition. He was in two minds over what he should do. A thought came into his mind that he should seek help from Imam Mahdi (as) so that he (as) can help him resolve his difficulty. While he began to seek help from Imam Mahdi (as), he saw suddenly that a person with a splendid personality was walking alongside him. This person said, Mister! Take this money which will be sufficient to reach Samarrah. When you reach Samarrah, you can get in touch with my representative, Sayyed Mirza Shirazi. When you meet him, inform him that Sayyed Mahdi has sent you to him. Inform him that some of his money is in his possession and from that, he should give you that much amount which will help you to reach the Ziyarat of Imam Ali Reza (as). The poor person says that I was not very attentive to the words of this Sayyed. Finally I said, When I meet Sayyed Shirazi, he will definitely ask me who is the person who has sent you. What did he look like and what are his special features? What will I reply to him? He said, When Sayyed Shirazi will ask you, you should inform him that Sayyed Mohammed said that this year, in the summer, you visited Shaam (Damascus) for the Ziyarat of my aunt Hazrat Zainab (sa) along with Mulla Ali Kani Tehrani. Due to the high number of pilgrims, some dirt had collected there in the courtyard. At that time, you had taken off your cloak (Aba) and starting cleaning the courtyard. You collected the dirt at one place and Haji Mulla Ali Kani threw it out. At that time, I was there… The person narrates that when I reached Samarrah and related this episode to Ayatollah Shirazi, he involuntarily stood up in his place.

At Najaf, he fell ill and despite best efforts, he did not get any special benefit from the treatment of the doctors.Doctors advised him to rest and told him he should avoid too much stress from walking or travelling as it was not good for him; rather it could be fatal for him since his body did not have strength to walk. Due to his diagnosis, he was distressed, and upset, and was compelled to stay in Najaf. The people of his group waited along with him for a few days. However when they saw no signs of improvement in his health, they packed their bags with the intention of leaving for Makkah. With great regret, they visited the shrine of Hazrat Ameerul Momeneen (as) and explained their situation to an aide in the shrine. They said, brother! We are Iranis and left from Kashan for the Ziyarat of Makkah. Unfortunately one member from our group has fallen sick. We took him to several doctors, but the treatment has not helped him. We wish to go forward to Makkah. Can you do us a favour and look after him in our absence? We will return soon from our Ziyarat. We will compensate you for this effort. Also, since he is unwell, God forbid if he passes away, then please conduct his the last rituals of ghusl and shroud and bury him. Keep his possessions with yourself. When we return, we will collect them from you and pass them on to his family members in Kashan. If he improves in health, then Inshallah, next year, we can take him for Ziyarat of Makkah. Finally they left this poor person in the custody of the aide and went away. This aide was a rude and harsh person. Every morning, he would lock the patient in his room and go away. He would return only in the afternoon after Asr. The patient would remain all alone in the dark room in a state of regret and sorrow. Finally after days of hunger and thirst, one day, in the morning, when the aide was preparing to lock him in the room, he said, Mister! I am not having the strength to walk. Can you do me a favour and take me any how to Wadi-us-Salaam. There is the place known as the place of Imam Mahdi (as). When I was better, I had gone there with my friends. When you return in the afternoon, you can pick me up from there. The patient pleaded and implored the aide to such an extent, that finally he agreed. He took the patient to Wadi-us-Salaam at the place of Imam Mahdi (as). There he made the patient sit in one corner. Then he washed his shawl and hung it to dry on a tree. Then he turned to the patient and said, see I have hung my shawl to dry. Do ensure that no one takes it. Saying this, he left from there. The patient narrates, hardly some time had passed after the aide had gone that my mind wandered to the question as to why this place was known as the place of Imam Mahdi (as). Did the Imam bestow a special grace upon some person at this place? Or had some person met the Imam (as) at this place? I was lost in these thoughts when suddenly I saw a young man enter the Wadi and come close to me. He conveyed salaams and passed from my side. Then he turned again towards me and spoke something in Arabic which I could not understand. I spoke to him in Persian saying, Mister! I could not understand a word of what you just spoke. He replied to me in Persian, where are you from? I replied, from Iran. He asked, from which city in Iran? I replied, from Kashan. He asked, from which locality of Kashan? I replied, from the locality of Sultan Meer Ahmed. He started conversing with me in Persian in such a Kashani style that I thought to myself that actually this person is from Kashan only and that he is only dressed as an Arab. He asked, what are you doing here? I replied, Sir! We were a group of friends who left Kashan with the intention of visiting Makkah. Since I fell ill here, they left have left me here and have gone ahead for the Ziyarat of Makkah. He said, Inshallah, you shall recover well from your illness and will visit Makkah, but not this year, but next year. I said, Sir! I am all alone here without any helper. I request you to sit here for some time with me so that my saddened heart may be pleased with your presence. Hearing this, he sat down. However after some time, he got up to leave. I said, Sir! There is no one here. The loneliness is killing me and my heart is troubled. I request you to spend some more time with me. Once again he sat down for some time, then he got up to leave. Again, I pleaded with him to stay for some more time to which he responded, I have to reach other some other place. Saying this, he got up and left. Not much time had passed since his departure that a strong gust of wind blew the shawl which was hanging on the tree to the ground. I got up from my place, picked up the shawl, washed it again and hung it on the tree to dry. Then I returned to my place to take rest. At that instant, it struck me that I was not having any strength to walk, leave alone wash the shawl. How is it possible that I was able to get up from my place and walk to the tree and wash the shawl and hang it to dry. I was astounded by this scene and I got up from my place again just to check that I was able to do so. I walked a few steps as well and observed that I felt no pain. At this point, the question which arose again and again was how I had managed to get up and walk. Then I thought that perhaps the person who had come was none other than Hazrat Imam Mahdi (as) who cured me of my illness. How is it that I was unable to recognise him…");

        esrc.add("Najmus Saqib");
        edetails.add("In the book of Najmus Saqib, there is an incident narrated about Shaykh Mohammed Taher Najafi. The Shaykh served with Masjid Kufa for many years and was staying there along with his family. He was a very pious and God fearing person. Towards the latter part of his life, he became blind.Some of the scholars have narrated his incident as follows – A few years ago a fight erupted between two tribes in the city of Najaf. Due to this war-like situation, the scholars and visitors to Najaf were unable to travel to Masjid Kufa. It was for quite some time, that in the city of Najaf, the hotels with which I was associated were not seeing any pilgrims due to the wars. Even the scholars were not coming to Najaf. At this, I became very worried as I had a large family to support. There was an added responsibility of some orphans on me also. Things were getting very difficult and I was living a hand to mouth existence. On one Shabe Jumuah it so happened that there was nothing to eat at all. My children were crying due to hunger. At this time, my heart was very sad. I left my house and began walking and narrating my condition to Allah. I said to Allah, “O Allah! I am satisfied with my condition and whatever you have ordained for me. But what should I do – I have yet to be blessed with a visit of my master Imam Mahdi (as). If you grant me permission to see the honourable face of my master Imam Mahdi (as), I promise that I will never ask you for anything else ever again and will be happy and satisfied with the poverty that you have destined for me.” Suddenly, I got up from my place. I saw a white cloth my hand (this cloth was one which people normally place at the place of prostration in namaz). My other hand was in the hands of a handsome and awesome youth. His strong personality and striking features gave me the impression that he was some emperor. My mind was in a daze and I did not know what is happening. Then I saw that he had worn a green turban and a person dressed in white clothes was standing next to him. We started walking towards the mehraab (prayer niche) in the mosque. When we reached there, the person who had taken hold of my hand turned to me and said, “O Taher, spread the cloth for namaz.” I spread the cloth. It was the whitest cloth I had ever seen and was outstandingly beautiful, but I could not make out the material with which it had been made. As I laid out the cloth and turned it towards the Qiblah, this handsome Sayyed stood on it and began reciting his namaz. I was mesmerized by his presence and slowly the noor (light) from his face increased so much that it was difficult to look at his face directly. His companion too stood behind him and got busy in reciting his prayers. I stood ahead of them and was watching them. Who are these persons, I wondered? When they had completed their prayers, I saw that the person who was praying behind was no longer with us. Before I could absorb this, I became aware of a chair, which was about 4 feet in height and even had a shade attached to it. The respected Sayyed who was praying ahead on the white cloth was sitting on it. The illumination from the chair and the face of this person was making it difficult for my eyes to see. The respected Sayyed said, “O Taher, which emperor do you take me for?” I said, “O Master, you are the emperor of emperors. You are a leader in knowledge and are not like the other kings.” Then he said, “O Taher, you have succeeded in your objective (of meeting Imam Mahdi (as)). What do you wish now? Do we not take care of your needs everyday? Are your deeds not presented before us?” Finally the respected Sayyed promised me that my condition and wealth would improve and that I would never face poverty again. At that time, a sinful person, who I knew by name and character entered Masjid Kufa from the direction of the courtyard of Hazrat Muslim Ibne Aqeel (as). Suddenly I saw that the holy face of Imam was seized with anger. He turned his face towards that person and said, “Till where will you run and escape? Is no the earth and heaven our kingdom? Follow the orders which we have issued, for you have no choice.” Then he turned towards me, smiled and said, “You have fulfilled your desires. Now do you want anything else?” I was so dumbstruck by his magnificence and brilliance that I could not speak up. He repeated his question and again I was in such a state that I could not reply. I was unable to express my happiness in words. Then within a flash, I saw that I was alone in the mosque and that Imam Mahdi (as) had disappeared. I looked towards the east and saw that morning was almost upon me.\\’ After this, the Shaykh says that the doors of sustenance were opened to him and he never faced the shortage of anything in my life. The truth is that to love Imam Mahdi (as) to that extent that the love of meeting him is created is the best cushion for this world and Hereafter. And by meeting him (as), the poverty of the world and Hereafter is removed. With this incident Imam Mahdi (as) has pointed out towards two important things. One is that we must pay special attention towards our deeds because our deeds are reported to him (as). It is narrated that if our deeds are good then Imam (as) becomes happy and prays for more reward for us. However, if our actions are bad, then Imam (as), after looking at them cries and wails over them. We must ask ourselves this question – have we been created to make our Imam cry over us or that we cry over Imam Husain (as). The other thing, which Imam (as) has pointed out, is that he is not unaware of our affairs. It may be another thing that we may be involved in problems due to the examinations but it is only through the infallible Imams (as) that our problems will be solved. And the blessings of this world and the Hereafter can be achieved.");

I went into the kitchen and while preparing tea, tried to hear what they were saying. I tried my best to understand their conversation, but was unable to do so. They were conversing in Arabic. When the tea was prepared, I poured it into a cup and placed it in front of him. He said, I don\\’t drink tea. I said, please recite some dua by which he can benefit and be cured by it. He picked up the cup of tea, recited a dua and blew into it. He then kept it back in its place and after conveying greetings, got up and left from there. When he reached the door of the room, he turned towards me and offered some advice regarding Janab Rafe\\’ei. Then he told me something about him which no person was aware about. But even then I did not pay attention to it. Then after conveying greeting, he turned and left the room. I said to myself, it is better that I accompany him to the door of the courtyard and bid him goodbye. With this thought in mind, I started walking towards him. However, he had barely left the house, when he disappeared. I was stunned at this occurrence and rushed out of the house to catch a glimpse of him. However there was no one except for my neighbour in the lane of our house. I asked her, a person with such and such features just stepped out of my house. Did you see him. Did you see which way he went? He appeared surprised by my questions. She said, I have not seen any person leaving your house. Perhaps you have seen a dream.

He eventually lost all hope of a cure.One day, I saw him hale and hearty walking towards me which surprised everyone since we all knew that he was still suffering from the disease. We asked him the cause for the cure to which he replied, one day, I vomited a lot of blood. The doctors had also given up and considered my disease to be incurable. I too had lost all hope for any cure from the doctors and thought that perhaps it was beyond them as well. I was thinking what I should do when it came into my mind that I should go and meet with Ayatollah Gharawi and seek some kind of advice from him. Thus, I went and narrated my entire condition to him. When I narrated my condition, he said, are you not a Sayyed? Why don\\’t you seek help from your blessed forefathers? Why don\\’t you seek the solution of your problems from Hazrat Imam Mahdi (as)? Don\\’t you know that in this age, he is the manifestation of the beautiful names of the merciful Lord? Have you not read Dua Kumayl where Imam Ali (as) says, O the One whose name is a remedy and who remembrance is a cure. He said, if you are a Shiah, and a Sayyed as well, then starting today, seek the help of Imam Mahdi (as) for your difficulty. Finally, through such words and exhortations, he awoke my dormant conscience. While listening to his words, my eyes became moist. I stood up from my place and in order to present myself before the Imam began reciting – Ya Hujjat Ibnil Hasan, Adrikni (O Proof, the son of Imam Hasan Askari (as), help me). Reciting these words, I started walking towards the shrine of Imam Ali Reza (as). When I entered the old courtyard of the shrine, it felt different than usual. The courtyard was empty and I saw only a few people who were walking together. They were walking behind a Sayyed. When I saw him, my mind instantly said that this Sayyed is Imam Mahdi (as). Since there was some distance between us, I thought that it should not happen that he leaves from here and I miss the opportunity to meet him. Therefore I thought it better to I call out to him and request his intercession to cure me of this illness. Barely had this thought crossed my mind that I saw the Imam (as) change his direction and look towards me. All of a sudden, I saw that the courtyard had changed to its original form and there was no sign of those people. The public were coming and going as usual. This change in scene cast a strange feeling over me. At that moment I felt that my illness had been cured completely.

To the best of my ability, I tried to complete the Tawaf, but found it difficult to do so. I managed to complete five rounds of the Kaabah, but in the sixth round, I was pushed aside. When this happened several times, I lost hope, left the Tawaf and went to one corner of Masjidul Haram and began crying there. I pleaded with Allah (swt) saying, O my Lord! I ask you by the right of the Prophets (as) and the Imams (as), that you send Imam Mahdi (as) to help me. In a short while I saw a Sayyed coming towards me. He called out to me by name and said, do you want to perform Tawaf? I replied, yes. He said, come with me for Tawaf. An old person who had dyed his hair was accompanying him. I said, O Sayyed! It is impossible to perform the Tawaf right now! He replied, why not? Come perform Tawaf with us. I said, Sayyed! Is it okay that I clutch your ehraam (dress of the Haji) from behind. As you walk ahead, I will follow your footsteps and complete the Tawaf. He said, no problem, come with me. I said, in the same manner, this old person will come behind me. He said, no problem. Since you are from the family of the Prophet (sawa), he will not mind. Thus, I clutched the ehraam of the Sayyed and we began the Tawaf in the manner that I was in the centre, the young Sayyed was in front and the old person was behind me. During the Tawaf, I realised that there was no person ahead or around us. It was as if the crowd had disappeared and the place had been emptied for us. However even then I did not realise who this person is. Finally he said, mister! We have completed seven rounds, now you can go and kiss Hajare\\’ Aswad (the black stone).

I asked him the cause of damage in this eye to which he narrated this incident. I had a friend by the name of Khairaat Khan. He made a programme to travel to his home town so he came up to me and said, I am planning to visit my native place for some days. So while I am away, you please sleep in my room at the madrasah (religious school). I agreed and soon thereafter he left for his home. Once, in the early part of the night, I left for Ziyarat to the shrine of Imam Reza (as). I busied myself in the recitation of Quran, Ziyarat and other duas. After a long time I came outside and remembered my promise to sleep in my friend\\’s room. However I realised that it was very late and it was likely that it the door to his room would be closed. I did not know what to do. I regretted the delay and was lost in my thoughts regarding the next course of action. Finally, I started walking towards the madrasah. I reached the madrasah and put my hand on the door. To my pleasant surprise, it opened easily. When I entered, I saw two people standing near the hawz (water pond) in the madrasah. One of them was aged and the other was young. I wondered what they were doing there at that time of the night. I observed that their faced radiated a light which illuminated the darkness of the madrasah. I was lost in my amazement of the scene, when the young person called out to me by name and said, how are you? I replied, Alhamdulillah, I am fine. He said, if you have any difficulty, then you can narrate it to me. After this he smiled at me and started conversing with me. I was so awe struck in his presence that none of my difficulties and problems came to my mind. I said, No, thank you. I have no problems. I was facing them when they started walking towards the door of the madrasah. When they passed by me, the aged person turned towards me and said, did you recognise this person (the youth)? I replied in the negative. He said, this person is your Imam Mahdi (as). If you have a difficulty of any kind, you can narrate it to him. However even after that I was unable to gather my wits and say anything. The instant they stepped out of the madrasah, I came to my senses and rushed towards the door. But as soon as I reached the door, I saw that the door was shut and to my astonishment, the door was latched from inside. I was stunned that how they were able to go outside when the door is locked from inside. Anyways, I opened the door and stepped outside. I searched for them but could not find any sign of them. I became certain that the person was Imam Mahdi (as). I regretted that I did not recognise him.");

I saw a person in the courtyard near one of the rooms of the shrine selling religious books.Since I was known to him, as soon as he saw me, he turned towards me and said, Mister! I have a book just suited for you. If you want you can take it. It will be of great benefit to you. This book has beautiful verses of poetry, and what\\’s more, I won\\’t even charge you any money for it. I only want that you read it for me. I took the book from it. As soon as I opened it, I saw that it contained the verses of praise written by Ibne Arandous Hilli. I had lost this and was searching for it for quite some time. Immediately, I took the book and said, okay, I will read it aloud for you. As soon as I started reciting it, I felt the presence of a person next to me. I turned and saw that an Arab was standing beside me. As I continued to recite, he wept profusely till such time that I recited the sentence of the elegy, Was Husain (as) really martyred in Karbala thirsty And was every part of his body, even the tips of his fingers not satiated with water? As I recited the above verses, the intensity of his lamentation reached its peak and while weeping, he turned towards the zarih of Imam Husain (as) and kept on repeating the above verses. His lamentation was like that of a mother who has lost her young son. Thereafter, I completed the recitation of the verses and turned towards the Sayyed, but, to my amazement, I did not find anyone there. I was surprised with this scene because till then he was just standing and weeping beside me. However I could not see him any longer. I asked the book seller whether he knew of the whereabouts of the Arab who was standing beside me. He replied, I did not see any person standing and weeping next to you. I searched all over for him – inside the haram and even in the precincts of the shrine, but I could not find any trace of him. I was then 100% sure that the Arab was none other than Imam Mahdi (as).");

               "Sayyed Taqi Qateefi reports – On one eve of Friday, I decided to spend the night at Masjid Kufa. In those days, the road to the mosque was fraught with danger. It was for this reason that perhaps this road was not very frequented by travellers. Only those who travelled in groups or those who had the ability to defend themselves from thieves and dacoits could travel on that road. I went even though I was accompanied only by a student.When we entered the mosque, there was only one pious and devout person there. We began performing the special acts of the mosque till such time that the sun set. Due to the prevailing fearful conditions at that time, we closed the doors of the mosque and stacked up bricks and stones against it. We were now relieved and very confident that no person would be able to open the door of the mosque. We returned to our places and continued the acts of the mosque. When we completed the acts of worship of the mosque, both the student and I sat at Dakkatul Qaza facing the Qiblah (This is the place in Masjid Kufa where Hazrat Ameerul Momeneen (as) used to pass judgements). At that time, the pious worshipper was in the courtyard of the mosque, weeping profusely while he was reciting the supplication of Kumayl. The moon had risen till then and had cast its soft light in the mosque. A thought just came to my mind and I looked towards the sky when I sensed a captivating fragrance in the air. The entire surroundings were perfumed by it. This fragrance was far better than musk or any other fragrance I had experienced before. Then I saw a light, so brilliant that it engulfed the light of the moon. I was observing this light when the sound of the supplication of the pious believer became silent. As I turned towards the direction of the believer, I saw a magnificent personality who was coming from the direction of the door of the mosque. He was dressed in the attire of the people of the Hejaz (Arabs). He had a prayer mat on his shoulder. With great splendour and majesty, he began walking towards the door near the shrine of Hazrat Muslim Ibne Aqeel. At that time, a strange feeling came over me. Our eyes were dazzled by the brilliance of his countenance and we had lost all our thoughts. When he came close to us, he conveyed his salaams to us. My partner was so dumbstruck that he did not have the strength to even reply to the salaam. I too was mesmerised, but anyhow, I managed to reply to the salutation. When this majestic personality entered the courtyard of the shrine of Hazrat Muslim, our senses returned as if miraculously. We looked at each other asking, who was this person? How did he enter the mosque while we had closed the door of the mosque in such a manner that it was impossible for any person to enter. We were still stumped with these questions when we decided to go to the pious believer who was earlier reciting Dua Kumayl. However we saw that he his condition was such that he was weeping like one overwhelmed by difficulties. We asked him, what is the matter? Why are you weeping so much? He replied, I have been coming here for the last 40 Thursday nights with the intention of meeting Imam Mahdi (as). However, I am distressed that till now I have not been blessed with the opportunity of meeting the Imam (as). I was just reciting Dua Kumayl tonight, when a person came up to me and said, what are you reciting? I was overawed by his presence that I could not reply to his question and he went away as you just witnessed. We rushed to the door of the mosque and saw that it was shut in the same secure way as we had left it and was blocked by stones and bricks. At that time, it struck us that the person we met in the mosque was none other than Imam Mahdi (as). We regretted that we were unable to recognise him.");

I took this bundle and went to the Hashemi fort. Along the way I saw a distinguished personality coming towards me. As I came close to him, I observed that he was wearing a black turban and had a green cloth on his waist. I was dazzled by the brilliant light emanating from his face. I was mesmerised and awe struck by this scene. He said to me, Sayyed Hashim! Acquire knowledge. Why are not you studying? It does not befit a sayyed that he remains bereft of knowledge. I replied, Mister! I am a poor man and don\\’t have the financial means to study. He said, Visit the university for studying. As regarding the issue of money, I will instruct Mulla Hashim. He will help you in this regard. He added, Ask the people of your village that why do they trouble the maulana? We had a conversation till such time that suddenly he became silent and I could not hear his voice. I looked up towards the person, but I could not see him anymore. I concluded that the person who was my companion for this time was no ordinary person, but he was the Imam of the time, Imam Mahdi (as). I regretted that he had vanished. I searched everywhere for him, but did not get an opportunity to meet him again. With tears in my eyes, I returned home and sat in a corner. I was grieved by his separation and cried for some time. I deeply regretted that I had not recognised my master Imam Mahdi (as). Seeing my distressed condition, my mother enquired, why are you crying? I narrated the entire episode to her. After some time, Sakina Khatoon, a maid at the house of Mulla Hashim came to my house and said, the maulana has called for you. I stood up from my place and rushed to his house. I stood at his door, and after securing his permission, I entered his house. On seeing me, he asked, Sayyed Hashim! How is your condition? Today you met a person on the road. What did he say to you? I was surprised how he knew of the incident since I had not disclosed this incident to any person. When I narrated the entire episode to him, he said, congratulations! The person you are referring to was Hazrat Imam Mahdi (as). He (as) came to my house and granted me the opportunity to meet him. He has instructed me in your regard. From today, I will pay your entire fees for the university. You can commence your studies without any worry. However, there is one thing – do not disclose this secret to anyone till the time I am alive. Therefore till the time he was alive, I did not speak of this matter to anyone.");

Should the womb of this lady be cut to extract the child or should she be buried in the same condition? Shaykh Mufeed replied, the lady should be buried in this condition only.Having received a reply, the person left from there. However, not much time had elapsed when he sensed that a person is coming behind him on horseback. The horse rider called out to him, Mister! Shaykh Mufeed has said that the womb of the lady should be cut, the child should be taken out and then the lady should be buried. The person returned back to his village and acted as per the directive of the fatwa (religious decree). After a few years, the villager narrated the entire episode of the horse rider to Shaykh Mufeed. He said, I did not send any person after you. Therefore the person who guided you was none other than Imam Mahdi (as). This means that I have made an error of judgement in issuing fatwas regarding the laws of the faith. Therefore from today I will not issue any further fatwas. Saying this, Shaykh Mufeed closed the door of his house and did not leave his house. He was in a state of remorse and regret. However in a short time, a tauqee (letter) was issued by Imam Mahdi (as) in favour of Shaykh Mufeed, the gist of which was, your duty is to issue the fatwa. My responsibility is to correct it. Have faith that I will not allow you to fall into error. Thus, after receiving this letter, Shaykh Mufeed resumed the issue of fatwas from his side.");

As I walked towards the shrine, I sensed that there was a person ahead of me. I quickened my pace so that I could catch up with him and see who it is. As I came close to him, I observed that it was Muqaddas Ardabeli.I slowed down and began walking behind him to understand where he was going so late in the night. I followed him at a short distance till such time that he reached the door of the holy shrine and stopped there. I too stopped behind to observe what his next step would be. He called out to someone but I could not understand what he said. At this time, the door of the shrine opened and a voice called out to him – Janab Ardabeli, come in. He went inside the shrine. I wanted to follow him and ran to the door, but by then the door had closed and I had to wait outside. After some time he came outside and went in the direction of the market. From there he left along the road which led to Masjid Kufa. I followed him at a distance till he reached Masjid Kufa. In the mosque, the place known as place of Hazrat Ibrahim appeared illuminated by a light. Muqaddas Ardabeli went towards that light and stood respectfully before it. I tried my best to come closer and observe what is happening, but was unable to do so. After some time, Muqaddas Ardabeli left from there and returned back to Najaf. Once again, I followed him. When we crossed Masjid Hannana, I sneezed. He immediately turned in the direction of the sound and said, who is it? I said, I said, it is me. He replied, Meer, is it you? I replied in the affirmative and said, I have been following you from Najaf Ashraf. I wanted to enter the shrine along with you, but the door closed before I could enter. I hid there for some time and waited for you to come out. Thereafter, I walked behind you for the entire distance of eleven kilometres till Masjid Kufa. While you stood before the light, I waited at a distance and tried to observe what was happening. After that I followed you from the mosque till I sneezed. For the sake of God, please do clarify this matter for me. Muqaddas Ardabeli asked me to promise that I would not disclose this secret to any person in his lifetime. I did so. He said, O Meer! Whenever I faced any difficult religious query, I sought its answer from Imam Ali (as). He (as) always responded to my queries and solved my difficulties. Today, I was presented with a religious query which, despite my best efforts, I was unable to get its answer. So I came, as was my custom, to the door of Imam Ali (as) so that he could relieve me of this difficulty. This time however, he instructed me to go to Masjid Kufa and meet his son, Hazrat Imam Mahdi (as) and present this case to him. He would provide me with the answer. Thus, I met Imam Mahdi (as) in the mosque and he gave me a satisfactory answer to my question. All praise be to Allah! Our countless salutations upon our scholars and may the mercy and blessings of Allah (swt) be upon those who had the good fortune of meeting with Imam Mahdi (as)! Indeed they were blessed with a good fortune to meet with the Imam (as) and to benefit from the ocean of his (as) knowledge. O Allah! Grant us too the opportunity to meet with the Imam of the Time, Hazrat Imam Mahdi (as). Ameen!");

After covering some distance I saw a person in Arab attire coming towards me on foot. He came very close to me and started walking alongside me.After some time, he asked me a question which affected me a lot and got me thinking that he is no ordinary person. Rather, he came across as a scholar of the highest rank. Thereafter, I asked him a few difficult questions which he was able to easily answer to my satisfaction. This convinced me 100% that he is the most knowledgeable person of this time because I had never come across any person like him ever in my life. This question and answer interaction was highly engaging and I was genuinely awe struck and mesmerized by him. During the course of this conversation, we discussed a question, his answer to which was against my view. I said to him, your response is against the rule. There is no proof in any tradition or narration which supports your view to be correct and acceptable. He replied, my view is supported by the tradition reported by Shaikh Tusi in his book Tehzeeb. I said, there is no such tradition in Tehzeeb. I do not recollect this tradition, either in the book of Shaikh Tusi or in that of any other scholar. He said, this tradition is on so and so page number and line number in your copy of Tehzeeb. This reply really stumped me and I thought to myself – perhaps this person travelling with me is none other than my beloved, my master Imam Mahdi (as). To validate this, I asked him, is it possible to meet Imam Mahdi (as) in this age. He bent down and picked up the whip and handing it over to me said, why not? Right now, his hand is your hands! Hearing this, I threw myself from the horse back to his feet so that I may kiss his blessed feet, however I was so overwhelmed by happiness that I swooned. When I came to my senses, I saw that I was alone. I regretted my separation from my master. I returned home and the first thing I did was pull out my copy of Tehzeeb. As I turned the pages, I reached the page which the Imam (as) had indicated and read the tradition. It was exactly as the Imam (as) had narrated, at exactly the same place the Imam (as) had said it would be. I wrote on the margin of the book, next to the tradition – This is the tradition which my master Imam Mahdi (as) has taught me. How privileged are those individuals who have been blessed with the good fortune to meet with Imam (as) in the period of Ghaybat (occultation)! This opportunity is available to believer wherever they may be in the world. All that one needs is strong belief accompanied with good deeds.");

                "Mirza Zainul Abedeen Salmaasi says – Once it so occurred that some wealthy people from Tehran came to Najaf Ashraf for Ziyarat and stayed at my residence. One early Wednesday morning, I brought them over from Najaf to the mosque of Kufa. We sat together in that part of the mosque where Hazrat Ameerul Momeneen (as) used to recite his prayers and was fatally wounded with the sword.We had just sat there when Maulana Abdul Hameed Qazvini came there. He was carrying a tumbler of water and a food mat under his arm. He saw and turned in my direction. When he saw the other people from Tehran, he turned away and went in the direction of the grave of Janab Muslim Ibne Aqeel. I called out to him, Come over, all of these are our people only. He came over and sat down amongst us. We exchanged greetings and then I asked him, where were you? He replied, Last night, as it was the eve of Wednesday, I was in Masjid Sehla till morning. I came to Kufa and soon I will leave for Najaf. I said, what is it with you that you frequently visit the mosque of Sehla? Have you observed something special there? He kept silent and did not reply. When I pressed him further for details, he said, I was once deep in debt and I had no means to repay it. I was very fearful that I should not die while I was having loans on my neck. God forbid, if that had to happen, how would I face the people (on the Day of Judgement). With these worries, I went one day to the blessed shrine of Hazrat Ameerul Momeneen (as). I just sat there and fixed my eyes on at the grave of the Imam (as). I was narrating my difficulties to the Imam (as) when a young student passed from there and said to me, Janab Abdul Hameed Qazvini, why are you looking so worried? I replied that I am very deep in debt and am troubled how I will repay my loans. He said, you are anxious for nothing. I said, why do you say that? He replied, the one who has Imam Mahdi (as) with him, then he has no reason to be worried. I was highly inspired by these words of the student and said, so what should I do? He said, go and spend 40 Tuesday nights (eve of Wednesday) in Masjid Sehla and seek help from Imam Mahdi (as). Inshallah, he will solve your difficulties. Thus, I started visiting Masjid Sehla every Tuesday night. Even before the passage of 40 nights, I was able to repay my entire loan. I was very motivated by this and made up my mind that I will repeat this act and spend another 40 Tuesday nights in Masjid Sehla, this time with the intention of getting an opportunity to meet with my master Hazrat Imam Mahdi (as). I was performing this act regularly when the fortieth Tuesday night of the sequence fell on the day of Arbaeen (fortieth day of martyrdom) of Imam Husain (as). On account of Arbaeen, people were travelling to Karbala. I was in a dilemma. If I went to Karbala, I would lose the fortieth night in Masjid Sehla and it is not appropriate that I don\\’t go to Karbala on Arbaeen. Finally, I decided that, God willing, if life permitted, I would perform the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (as) next year. This year, I decided that I would complete the act which I had set out to do. On Tuesday night, I reached Masjid Sehla and found that I was alone. Everybody had left for Karbala. There was no one there and the mosque was enveloped in darkness. I completed the aamaal of Masjid Sehla, went to the roof of the mosque and after eating something, I went to sleep. After about two and a half hours, a person came to the mosque and shaking my leg said, O Abdul Hameed Qazvini, get up. I awoke and saw an Arab standing over me. I said, Yes, what is it? He said, get up. If you wish to do the Ziyarat of the prince, then do so. I thought to myself, perhaps some ajamee (non Arab) person has come and this person wants me to meet him since I am the only one available here. With this thought in mind, I said to him, you go. I have nothing to do with him. Hearing my response, the Arab went away. As I lay down to go back to sleep, a thought struck me that anyways I had not gone close enough to him to meet him. It may not be a bad idea to catch a glimpse of him from afar and see who he is. I stood up and saw that a respected personality was seated in the western area of the mosque. His face was radiant as the full moon and some people were sitting around him. I turned to go back to sleep, but as I lay down a thought came to my mind that when I entered the mosque, all the lamps were silent and there was darkness all around. Then what was the reason that the mosque appeared illuminated? I got up from my place and went again to take a look, but saw that there was nobody there.");

Thereafter I used to go to the roof of the mosque and offer additional units of recommended prayers and recite some supplications.At the prime time of namaz, I used to offer Azaan and then come down and recite the morning prayer. This was my daily practice which remained unchanged for about twenty years. On one such night when it was extremely dark and a cool breeze was blowing softly, I arrived at the mosque. I saw that the door of the mosque was open and the mosque appeared illuminated. I thought to myself that perhaps the caretaker has forgotten to not just close the door, but also to snuff out the lamps of the mosque. I decided to go insider and see for myself. As I entered the mosque, I saw that a person of Persian descent, dressed in attire of a scholar was reciting prayers in the Mehraab (prayer niche) of the mosque. The entire mosque was illuminated, not by lamps, but by the light which was emanating from his face. I was a bit taken aback by this scene and thought who is this person who face is shining with so much light that the mosque is lit up by it. I moved closer to him and was lost in these thoughts that this personality completed his prayers and turned towards me and called me by my name. He said, instruct your pesh Imam (Sayyed Mohammed Sadiq Qummi) to come to the mosque. I left to call the maulana of the mosque, Sayyed Mohammed Sadiq Qummi. I reached his door and softly knocked upon it. He opened the door and I saw that he was already dressed with his turban and clothes as if he was just about to leave for the mosque when I conveyed salutations to him. I replied to my greeting. I said, O maulana! A respected Sayyed is in the mosque and has expressed his desire to meet you. He said, did you recognise who he is? I replied in the negative and only said that his face is shining with light and I have never seen such a radiant face in my entire life. Hearing this, the maulana kept silent and did not say anything. We both left for the mosque and entered it. I saw that the maulana treated the Sayyed with much respect and reverence and presented himself with a high degree of humility. After exchanging greetings, they sat next to each other and spoke for some time. After that the Sayyed left the mosque. I was amazed by the humility of the maulana. Just as the Sayyed left, I rushed to the maulana and asked him, who was this person? Why were you so humble in his presence? The maulana turned towards me and said, did you not recognise him? I replied in the negative. He said, if you promise that you will never disclose this incident to any person in my lifetime, I will inform you or else, no. I promised as he said. The maulana said, this person was your and my Imam Mahdi (as). On hearing this, I just stood up from my place and rushed towards the mosque, but I found that the door of the mosque was closed, it was dark and there was no person inside the mosque. I wanted to catch another glimpse of the Imam (as), but regretfully, it was not to be. I could not get an opportunity to do so. I could not understand the conversation between the Imam (as) and the maulana except that I heard the Imam (as) say – Offer the morning prayers in congregation at its prime time. Mulla Habeeb did not narrate this incident in the lifetime of Sayyed Mohammed Sadiq Qummi. He also swore thrice on the Holy Quran as a proof of the veracity of this incident.");
